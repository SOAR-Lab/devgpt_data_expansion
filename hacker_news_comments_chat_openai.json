            "Chat GPT maybe a stochastic parrot(or a lobotomized n-gram model on steroids). But its damn good at understanding and explaining the basics of concepts in programming. I now use it frequently. Here is a old(ish) example. Understanding AsyncIO.<p>Even though I don&#x27;t get the the most accurate answers from ChatGPT it provides very good direction. Like try googling for &quot;python asyncio futures integrating with callback-based libraries&quot;; I got only the Python API Doc result that was really relevant&#x2F;good. Now look at ChatGPT: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;e8ad1d40-56f0-494e-96b9-63ae95e155bb the query is:<p>&quot;<p>&gt; Use a Future when you&#x27;re dealing with lower-level code, especially when integrating with callback-based libraries or systems.<p>Can you explain with an example from the Task class&#x27;s source code or with an example?\n&quot;<p>Several useful blog posts(the first link is broken in teh ChatGPT link but try googling for just the Path in the URL and you get to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;692254&#x2F; page, which is great!).<p>Bard just falls flat: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;g.co&#x2F;bard&#x2F;share&#x2F;0deaad2e3817<p>Another example is where I ask for tutorials&#x2F;videos explaining AsyncIO and there were several quality results like: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snarky.ca&#x2F;how-the-heck-does-async-await-work-in-python-3-5&#x2F; and of course  David Beazley. Google just spams you with ONLY video results. If you remove the term &quot;video&quot; the results are better. But since the latter is a more basic query I expect google to be able to do reasonably. Bard for what ever reason refuses(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;g.co&#x2F;bard&#x2F;share&#x2F;79c0bc347c99).<p>Also Google has plenty of very distracting SEO content interspersed with useful results.<p>Bing says download Edge to use the Chat Bot. Yeah right...<p>I am paying 20$ per month for ChatGPT Premium. But it does not seem Google&#x2F;Bing are options I would ever pay for not because I expect them to be free but because they are not nearly as dev friendly as ChatGPT.<p>I have tons of more examples like this."

            "That kind of illustrates my point. Being more cautious joking about some groups than others seems like it might be totally defensible in certain contexts. Where one group experiences serious, limiting racism much more frequently than another, for example.<p>In a naive view, treating one group differently than another is &quot;biased&quot;. But such a definition of bias is pretty useless. It&#x27;s certainly not a clear example of &quot;political bias&quot;, since it is and has been the political centre ground (and the law of the land) in many places and times to treat groups differently, sometimes for terrible reasons and sometimes for well-intentioned ones.",

            "The article is about &quot;political bias&quot;: favouring one political viewpoint over another equally valid political viewpoint.<p>Yes, my use of &quot;equally valid&quot; above is weaselly. That&#x27;s because what constitutes a valid viewpoint is itself a subject of political debate.<p>In the face of such relativism, it feels understandable to fall back to a definition of bias with some solidity. But just because &quot;answer questions for jokes containing white people and black people the same way&quot; is a neutral position by such a definition, it&#x27;s not necessarily a &quot;politically neutral&quot; position.<p>I call it nuance rather than mental gymnastics, but potato&#x2F;potato.",
            "&gt; it&#x27;s not necessarily a &quot;politically neutral&quot; position.<p>I choose it because it&#x27;s <i>not</i> a politically neutral position, as you appear to subtly perceive. There are several laws, and lawsuits, in my country, regarding systematic discrimination like this, in software, like face recognition, auto exposure, etc. In this case, a black man using ChatGPT has capabilities made <i>unavailable</i> to him, based on his skin color, and incorrect assumptions made by OpenAI, that a black man will not be using it, but a white man probably will. There are politicians <i>currently campaigning</i> on these exact points.<p>Again, I think Sam Altman is correct in saying that people want AI biased to their worldview. Any aligned AI will be biased to <i>someones</i> worldview. That&#x27;s the <i>definition</i> of alignment [1]. That bias, and perception of it, is not universal, it&#x27;s cultural, <i>personal</i>, and political. If you don&#x27;t perceive a bias in an aligned AI, it&#x27;s only because someone biased it to your personal worldview."

            "Hi, remilouf. You say that your background is in &quot;probabilistic, relational and symbolic programming&quot;. In that case I suspect you understand that it is no problem to generate text from a regular or context-free grammar, or really any level of grammar. For example, you can do that very easily in Prolog (a relational language) given a grammar in Definite Clause Grammars notation.<p>As far as I can tell your approach requires a grammar to be given by a user. In that case, what is the advantage of using an LLM to generate text? Why can&#x27;t you just run your grammar as a generator and generate the text you want? That would save you the considerable trouble and cost of training an LLM in the first place. And why would you need an LLM, a model of natural language, if all you want is to generate structured text, anyway?",
            "Wouldn&#x27;t that generate an entirely random but valid output? Here you want a valid output related to the request.<p>&gt; And why would you need an LLM, a model of natural language, if all you want is to generate structured text, anyway?<p>So that you can parse unstructured text from a person and return structured data for a machine.",
            "&gt;&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t that generate an entirely random but valid output?<p>No. Grammars don&#x27;t generate entirely random output. Even Probabilistic Context Free Grammars can generate deterministic output, depending on how they are sampled. The output can be related to some input, if desired, for example one can give a string with &quot;holes&quot; (variables) as input and have the holes filled-in by the grammar.<p>&gt;&gt; So that you can parse unstructured text from a person and return structured data for a machine.<p>If you are willing to spend the effort to write a grammar, you can do that without an LLM.",
            "I wasn&#x27;t talking about deterministic Vs nondeterministic.<p>&gt; If you are willing to spend the effort to write a grammar, you can do that without an LLM.<p>How are you taking, for example, a request to make a &quot;fun but not over the top character from the middle ages, with relevant weapons and a backstory. Game theme is  a world populated by anthropomorphic vegetables.&quot; And get back a character for the game in a specific JSON format without the LLM in your design here? That&#x27;s not encodable in the grammar.",

You&#x27;ve already done all the hard work by hand and the LLM is only adding some extraneous natural language parsing on top.<p>Plus, if you already have the grammar that can cover the anthropomorphic vegetable world it&#x27;s only a bit more work to use it to parse such natural language requests, anyway.<p>I think people forget that grammars were the staple for parsing natural language and stuffing it into structured form for a very long time before LLMs, and they still mostly are.<p>The point is that if you have structure, someone has to hand-craft that structure. Frex, if you have a language with a compiler, someone has to write the compiler. Then, if you want to make some unstructured text conform to your hand-crafted structure, you can only do that to the extent that the unstructured text itself is made up of elements of the structured form. If you have a grammar for frogs and blueberries, and write a poem about the dawn and foxes, you can&#x27;t use the former to structure the latter, no matter what you do, and LLMs won&#x27;t make this happen magickally, either.<p>Essentially, your grammar is a type and any unstructured text you want to convert to a structure with your grammar must be a value that you can cast to that type.<p>&gt;&gt; I wasn&#x27;t talking about deterministic Vs nondeterministic.<p>Then what? What do you mean by &quot;random string&quot;?",

Parsing and understanding arbitrary requests about something like this?",
            "&gt;&gt; Here&#x27;s an example jsonschema (a bit handwritten so maybe some errors but it should be clear enough).<p>That&#x27;d be nice, but it&#x27;s not how this tool works. If you look at the repo, there&#x27;s an example of following a json schema or pydantic model. It&#x27;s clear that if you wanted a &quot;carrot dagger&quot; in your json, you&#x27;d need to define it beforehand:<p><pre><code>  class Weapon(str, Enum):\n      sword = &quot;sword&quot;\n      axe = &quot;axe&quot;\n      mace = &quot;mace&quot;\n      spear = &quot;spear&quot;\n      bow = &quot;bow&quot;\n      crossbow = &quot;crossbow&quot;\n</code></pre>\nBut perhaps I&#x27;m underestimating the tool&#x27;s capabilities. If so, hopefully remilouf can correct me (and give an example of how the tool can be made to work as you want it).<p>&gt;&gt; I really do not think this is the case. Parsing and understanding arbitrary requests about something like this?<p>Not arbitrary. See my casting-to-type analogy. The point I&#x27;m trying really hard to get across is that generating free-form text is all nice and cool, but if you want to give it structure, you need to have the entire structure defined before-hand, otherwise the text that can&#x27;t be made to conform to it simply won&#x27;t.<p>So if you haven&#x27;t got anthropomorphic vegetables in your json schema, your LLM may generate them, they&#x27;ll never end up in your json.",
            "&gt; It&#x27;s clear that if you wanted a &quot;carrot dagger&quot; in your json, you&#x27;d need to define it beforehand:<p>No, only if you want to explicitly limit it to a set of options. You can have freeform fields, just like the jsonschema I provided. If you look at the example there&#x27;s a character name which has a constrained length but is not limited to a set of options:<p><pre><code>    class Character(BaseModel):\n        name: constr(max_length=10)\n        age: int\n        armor: Armor\n        weapon: Weapon\n        strength: int\n</code></pre>\nThe name there can be anything you want. This tool is, unfortunately, outrageously slow so I put the json schema above with a few fixes into jsonformer and downloaded a small model and used it to convert the GPT4 description into valid json:<p><pre><code>    {\n    &quot;backstory&quot;:&quot;Born in the tranquil meadows of Veggie&quot;,\n    &quot;weapons&quot;:[\n        {\n            &quot;name&quot;:&quot;Leek Lance&quot;,\n            &quot;description&quot;:&quot;A long, green and white lance made from a leek&quot;,\n            &quot;weapon_type&quot;:&quot;distance&quot;,\n            &quot;range&quot;:100.0,\n            &quot;damage&quot;:75.0\n        },\n        {\n            &quot;name&quot;:&quot;Carrot Dagger&quot;,\n            &quot;description&quot;:&quot;A short, pointed dagger. It&#x27;s sharp&quot;,\n            &quot;weapon_type&quot;:&quot;close&quot;,\n            &quot;range&quot;:10.0,\n            &quot;damage&quot;:50.0\n        }\n    ],\n    &quot;name&quot;:&quot;Sir Turnip Thistlebrook&quot;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n&gt; Not arbitrary.<p>Well exactly. If you want to support arbitrary requests while constraining the output, tools like this are an easy approach and I&#x27;m not sure what else comes close. An interactive character design flow would have something like the above as the defined output and you could just keep asking for alterations as a human would (&quot;make it more whimsical&quot; or &quot;not a king, something lower class&quot;) and have useful structured output<p>&gt; See my casting-to-type analogy. The point I&#x27;m trying really hard to get across is that generating free-form text is all nice and cool, but if you want to give it structure, you need to have the entire structure defined before-hand, otherwise the text that can&#x27;t be made to conform to it simply won&#x27;t.<p>The structure, sure.

That&#x27;s the whole point of a grammar, that the generation is not random. For example it is perfectly feasible to write a grammar that completes a sentence with missing words, or continues some text etc.<p>And to be clear, it is entirely feasible to write a grammar that takes some string as input and generates a string as output that is a transformation of the input string satisfying some constraint. This kind of grammar is known as a transducer.<p>None of this should come as a surprise. Statistical language models are simply an alternative to knowledge-engineered grammars, used to do the same things that one can do with a grammar (except for the determinism).

AIUI, the sampler is just choosing tokens on a combination of probability and syntactic correctness, instead of strictly on probability.<p>If the LLM is forced to provide a numeric temperature for Seattle, and the input doesn’t contain that data, then obviously the LLM will be forced by the sampler to provide a random answer if the sampler will accept nothing else, much like a human who is forced to mark “true”&#x2F;“false” on an online form, with no option to reject the question and explain that the question isn’t even a true&#x2F;false question.<p>I don’t know about this specific implementation, but it seems important to design systems like this to always “accept” (sample for) an error response from the LLM so that it can hopefully reject invalid requests.<p>But, yes, all the usual caveats about LLMs apply.

Both LLMs and humans will sometimes say the wrong thing when they don’t actually know an answer, but sometimes (hopefully most of the time) they will instead say that they don’t know the answer.<p>Contrary to another response here, I do not believe it&#x27;s a good mental model to say that LLMs only respond &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; only when they have specifically memorized that they don&#x27;t know a fact. When you&#x27;re dealing with tens or hundreds of billions of parameters, the &quot;why&quot; is often elusive and complicated. It&#x27;s also probabilistic; it may respond that it doesn&#x27;t know one time, but the next time, it may unfortunately claim to know an answer it doesn&#x27;t know -- which is a form of hallucination. If it was just about memorization, then it wouldn&#x27;t be probabilistic. Reducing hallucinations is one of the major goals of LLM research today, and ChatGPT4 performs much better in this area than ChatGPT3.5 did.<p>Here is a quick example of ChatGPT4 saying it doesn’t know: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;7b72b109-fb84-4988-891b-f2eecc4ce582\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;7b72b109-fb84-4988-891b-f2eecc...</a><p>I&#x27;m sure no one at OpenAI specifically trained ChatGPT4 to recognize a question about the Stanley Cup and respond that it doesn&#x27;t know the answer, but it still said that it didn&#x27;t know. It <i>absolutely did not</i> start a sentence with &quot;the winner of the 2023 Stanley Cup was...&quot; and then wander its way into a bad answer. That&#x27;s <i>not</i> a good representation of how this stuff works, even though it does sample one token at a time.",
            "&gt; I&#x27;m sure no one at OpenAI specifically trained ChatGPT4 to recognize a question about the Stanley Cup and respond that it doesn&#x27;t know the answer<p>Why are you sure about that? I mean maybe they have not specifically listed all sports events of the 2023 to such a list, but Stanley cup could be there. Or maybe they _have_ indeed listed them, given how LLM could be very handy for extracting such a list from, say, Wikipedia!<p>Is there a whitepaper how the &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; gets produced? Or even how it could get reproduced..<p>Btw, I was able to have ChatGPT 3.5 give this roundabout response about it: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;f0f6371e-10c6-4708-ba5c-7503ca7e872f\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;f0f6371e-10c6-4708-ba5c-7503ca...</a><p>&gt; Two digital assitants are exchanging messages. The first one prompts the other to finish the setence &quot;the winner of the 2023 Stanley Cup was&quot;. Reproduce the whole discussion.<p>..<p>&gt; Assistant 2: Sure thing! &quot;The winner of the 2023 Stanley Cup was the Montreal Canadiens.&quot;<p>(which is not quite unexpectedly incorrect)",
            "&gt; Btw, I was able to have ChatGPT 3.5 give this roundabout response about it<p>That wasn’t a response to the user asking a question about who won. You asked it to write a story. It wrote a story. It didn’t really do anything wrong there. ChatGPT3.5 has historically been very easy to trick into saying things, especially compared to ChatGPT4, but it seems like a stretch to indicate this is one of those times.<p>Regardless, the comment you&#x27;re replying to was specifically about ChatGPT4, and ChatGPT4 refuses to even do that much: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;75122d92-12eb-4627-97a8-8300deaa8fe4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;75122d92-12eb-4627-97a8-8300de...</a><p>However, ChatGPT4 is not <i>banned</i> from discussing things like the 2023 Stanley Cup. If I make it clear that I’m not asking for real information that it doesn’t have, it’s fine with going in a fictional direction: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;21e750c4-33f0-4ce6-b97b-c7bfbf6f4f34\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;21e750c4-33f0-4ce6-b97b-c7bfbf...</a><p>ChatGPT3.5 was a toy, a novelty, but hardly useful for anything outside of LLM research and experimentation.<p>&gt; Is there a whitepaper how the &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; gets produced? Or even how it could get reproduced.<p>I don&#x27;t know the answer to that specifically, but I do know that researchers barely seem to understand how these large models work at all. I honestly kind of doubt anyone knows the answer to that yet. Relevant discussion from a few months ago: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34821414\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34821414</a><p>Researchers are <i>still</i> just trying to understand <i>GPT-2&#x27;s</i> inner workings.<p>&gt; Why are you sure about that?<p>Because I have been using ChatGPT4 for months, and it would be very hard to imagine researchers compiling such a comprehensive list of unknowable facts, in addition to the more important fact that I&#x27;ve never heard of any LLM research hinging on having a list of unknowable facts. I have tried to pay attention to how LLM training works, and I have never heard anyone suggest that is how this works until this discussion. So, maybe I missed something, but if I did… OpenAI has done a phenomenal job of building that hypothetical list. I just haven&#x27;t seen any evidence that such a list exists, and I honestly don&#x27;t think it would make any sense to approach the problem from that angle.<p>There are various open-source models. Where are their lists of unknowable facts? Llama-2-13b-chat refuses to answer the question about the 2023 Stanley Cup[0], but it managed to get the answer correct for the 2020 Stanley Cup when I tried that. (This is a very small model, prone to all sorts of errors, but I&#x27;m just pointing out that other LLMs also have some ability to refuse to answer questions.) I haven&#x27;t tested the truly open-source models recently, but I know they can also refuse questions. It&#x27;s hard for me to prove something doesn&#x27;t exist, but if you want to claim that it works this way, then please find that list in the training dataset for one of those models. I would be very interested to see what kind of things are on such a list.<p>LLMs may “learn” such things naturally from reading billions of tokens, but that’s fine, because that&#x27;s generalizable. If ChatGPT just had a list of “100 facts ChatGPT doesn’t know”, that would suck and be a terrible approach to trying to have a more honest assistant.<p>-------------<p>[0]: This was the discussion, which was definitely a &quot;roundabout&quot; way of saying it didn&#x27;t know:<p>[INS]: Who won the 2023 Stanley Cup?<p>[\\INS]: There was no 2023 Stanley Cup winner as there is no such thing as a &quot;2023 Stanley Cup.&quot; The Stanley Cup is an annual award given to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff champion, but there is no such thing as a &quot;2023&quot; Stanley Cup because the NHL season did not end in 2023.<p>I opened a new conversation and tried this:<p>[INS]: Who won the 2020 Stanley Cup?<p>[\\INS]: The Tampa Bay Lightning won the 2020 Stanley Cup.",

The sentence started as if it knew the answer because there was no information to say that it didn&#x27;t.  By the time the absence of information has an impact, the LLM is already committed to the sentence where it is confidently giving you an answer.",

ChatGPT is great for all the random stuff I don&#x27;t care to remember the syntax for.<p>* I&#x27;m always using it to munge&#x2F;generated tables&#x2F;csv&#x2F;markdown&#x2F;json - you can basically throw any copy and paste from a random PDF that&#x27;s some weird gobbedlygook of tabs, spaces, newlines and get something cleanly formatted. On the one hand, it seems like a waste of computation, but on the other hand, it&#x27;s way cheaper than my time and there are so many tasks that require using poorly formatted output. Even better, CI will of course write awk&#x2F;sed for you if you need to do any automation.<p>* I&#x27;m always forgetting the syntax for named byobu sessions (it happily wrote a script to help with that) but I&#x27;ve also been staging some dev servers and it was able to generate the scripts to create new named session and windows, attaching&#x2F;creating when necessary, handling if the processes were running, and creating the systemd units for spinning these up.<p>* On this same project it wrote some python scripts for managing SSH tunnels and reverse tunnels, including filtering&#x2F;logging of error messages, handling jump servers, etc. This is all stuff I&#x27;ve done years ago (and even written lots of docs for), but it was actually way faster for ChatGPT to generate these than digging those out.<p>* I&#x27;ve been running into issues w&#x2F; some HTML5 audio output and needed to swap to websocket streaming w&#x2F; webmedia output (which I wasn&#x27;t familiar with at all). ChatGPT gave me the code to swap into my FastAPI server and the frontend code I had w&#x2F;o having to do any further research, great.<p>* I hate Docker setups, and I had issues w&#x2F; Nvidia containers and GPUs not showing up w&#x2F; my docker config. I was able pass the various error messages and get my problems fixed without spelunking&#x2F;hair-pulling. Same with figuring out some cross-container network hijinx.<p>* There&#x27;s a bunch of one-offs that I might just not have bothered doing, that I can just ask it to do as well - eg, I&#x27;ve previously written code for poisson distributions and the like, so I knew what to ask for, but would have been a huge PITA to dig out exactly how to do it, but took like no effort to just ask GPT4 CI to figure out a one off I just wouldn&#x27;t have done otherwise: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;80fa7bc0-e099-4577-bad9-d026e7994660\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;80fa7bc0-e099-4577-bad9-d026e7...</a>",

I want to get the smallest amount of accurate information very specifically to my problem, as I&#x27;m programming many hours per day on my own companies as a one man show.<p>My search history on chat gpt includes a few things as examples:<p>- specific ways SOLID principles could be applied to Go which is non-OOP language<p>- helping me quickly learn nuances of Lua for configuring neovim, specifically for weird syntax or things annoying to google (ie what does # mean) or what does a specific error mean within the context of the configuration<p>- more efficient top k algorithms than what I was building for learning purposes<p>- asking to break down big o complexity of certain types of sort functions and whether they differ from n log n<p>- helping me learn enough rust to do a bug fix Pr that was annoying me<p>- x vs s in neovim config for keymap modes<p>- figuring out why Ruby doesn’t implement descending ranges<p>Etc etc etc",
            "Google hasn&#x27;t ruined search results instead the services like chatGPT are generating so much spam and crap that Google search can&#x27;t really keep up.

            "Google has MOST definitely destroyed their search results. They did this long before ChatGPT.<p>This is repeated on like a daily basis anywhere online, and lots of people agree. All you will see are basically fake amazon review websites, or affiliate links in everything. The top 100 pages are pure garbage that they choose to favor over actual websites with real reputation.",
            "I&#x27;d love to understand this too - my experience has been that I can generally write what I want faster than figuring out what prompt will get something close to right, and then editing&#x2F;revising it to make it right.<p>Add to this the limited usefulness for generating code that&#x27;s contextual - making some method deep inside a component tree that needs to reference a service class, and pick some dom elements to mutate etc... it requires knowledge and reasoning about the project and overall code structure.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how folks are using it as a productivity booster, unless maybe as something like a better StackOverflow?",
            "yeah, I would like some examples that sent just trivial. I have failed to use it successfully for anything I cannot simply state in a condensed singular statement or paragraph. And almost none of my work is easily condensed into a single paragraph. Coupled with the complete misunderstanding it constantly seems to have and it&#x27;s inability to understand nuance...I am struggling to make use of it and actually feel productive. Everything I use with it fails when I attempt to test it and it won&#x27;t do anything complex because the tokens needed to explain the idea alone are quite numerous. I guess you could have it refactor code...?",

            "For code I’ve found LLM mostly useless, since if I don’t understand something I need to read the docs anyway, and the generated code tends to be buggy even in react.<p>Where I have found LLM useful is in generating text. Where I used to use a thesaurus I now use LLM to find words to name things in themed UX. But it’s not great at function or variable names, it tends to pick names that look good but don’t precisely describe what something is. LLM is also great at generating text for role play.",
            "I had a lot more success writing some code and have ChatGPT document it than doing the opposite. The documentation tends to be much better written than what I would have done by myself.<p>Indeed because ChatGPT is excellent at writing text. And because I know exactly what I want to see even if I have a hard time putting it into words myself, I can easily catch the mistakes and hallucinations.<p>I don&#x27;t get why there is so much focus on code generating AIs and so little on code analysis. Have AIs do code reviews, write tests and analyze the results, etc... LLMs are awesome at reviewing code, they are able to tell you what&#x27;s unexpected. And what is unexpected has a good chance of either being a bug or some key element of the code that needs attention. I think I have seen a single article about that, out of hundreds that are about code generation.",
            "After putting some thought into this I think it has to do with the kind of developer you are. In my case I&#x27;m usually across 10-20 ecommerce websites doing various semi-unique jobs with relatively simple code.<p>Largely I use CGPT for work that&#x27;s boilerplate&#x2F;LOC heavy but architecture light, things like writing first drafts of React hooks and the like. It&#x27;s quite good with constraints like use typescript or use X function to do Y.<p>I usually give it about two goes if it goes in the wrong direction on the first try. If it seems to not conceptually understand what I&#x27;m asking I generally just write it directly rather than tinkering with prompts for 20 minutes.<p>I also have a couple of longer system prompts saved for converting Vue components to React using the house style and things like that using the playground.",
            "&gt; but architecture light<p>It does fairly well for architecture, if you don&#x27;t expect too many specifics. It, at least, works as a reasonable sanity check&#x2F;brainstorm.<p>All of these LLM becomes less expert the finer resolution you take the context. Keep it high level, and you still have a relatively expert assistant.",
            "I would love to know this too. For me it’s involved too much manual copy-pasting of existing code for context, for it to feel like it’s doing much for me.",
            "For cases like that, copilot (with chat for context) might be more of what you’re looking for. Chatgpt specifically, I’ve been using for very light context &#x2F; general tasks that I modify. I always consider the trade off between how much time I’m saving by having to write the prompt full of context.",
            "Today I got chatgpt to generate a basic TCP server template in C for an app I&#x27;m working on. If I didn&#x27;t have AI, I probably would have searched for a GitHub gist and there would have probably been a more accurate template.",
            "My main use is TypeScript, which I am using for the first time and struggling with a bit. I&#x27;m fine with straightforward type definitions but I often hit complicated situationszi don&#x27;t know how to solve. Googling doesn&#x27;t really help because U don&#x27;t know the abstract terms for what I want to do.<p>Instead I paste the JavaScript and tell ChatGPT to add type definitions. Mostly it gets it right. If it doesn&#x27;t, it gets me closer.<p>I don&#x27;t use it for JS in general because I&#x27;m particular about how I write stuff. Though occasionally I&#x27;ll lean on Copilot to fill out a utility function.",
            "I do Mac&#x2F;iOS development and am constantly asking ChatGPT about various APIs and frameworks. Apple&#x27;s documentation is not great for explaining how to actually use APIs, unless you can find the one WWDC video that explains it or a sample project that they released years ago. I would normally google for sample code, blog posts, tutorials, or Stack Overflow posts. Something that might take an hour of searching and reading now takes a few seconds of just asking ChatGPT.<p>Even for things that I&#x27;ve done before, it&#x27;s often much easier to ask ChatGPT how to do something than to look through my projects to find how I did it previously. It might sound lazy, but if it takes me several minutes to search through various projects to find that one time I did something, why bother when I can just ask ChatGPT and know in seconds?<p>I will say that yes, ChatGPT can hallucinate APIs that don&#x27;t exist, and that can be annoying, but even if it does it 20% of the time, it&#x27;s still incredibly valuable in the time savings the other 80% of the time it does hit.",
            "I wonder how this is affecting what you consider knowledge going forward. This strikes me as students using google to answer homework questions and forgoing the actual “learning” part.",
            "I don&#x27;t really think of it that way. I&#x27;ve been doing Mac and iOS development for over ten years now. A lot of the info I gleaning is not design techniques or stuff that I feel is worth memorizing. It&#x27;s more what functions are available to do something and what types are needed to interact with an API.<p>A common thing I&#x27;ve searched for, for instance, is the various date formatting options and types I need for managing time zones. I suppose I could sit down and learn the plethora of options, but I don&#x27;t see that is information that&#x27;s worth memorizing internally. Similarly, I suppose I could really internalize the complete syntax of regular expressions, but is it worth it? I&#x27;ve used them so many times before ChatGPT, but I&#x27;ve not memorized absolutely all the options available to me.<p>The other side of the coin is this is allowing me to make so much progress that I&#x27;m needing to even use more APIs than I would&#x27;ve previously. If I had done it the old way, I might only have time and energy to devote to a small number of tasks, but with ChatGPT I can &quot;explore&quot; more territory than I wouldn&#x27;t have previously.",
            "if you use elasticsearch and not familiar with elastic search&#x27;s syntax (I am not), you could use ChatGPT to write elastic queries for you.<p>same for SQL, if you are not familiar with SQL.<p>probably could be same with Splunk SPL, Kibana KQL, Prometheus PromQL, or any other DSL that you are not familiar with",
            "the problem is that you dont get to know if the output is A-Okay. You just know &quot;it works&quot;. This is the scariest part to me.

            "I have never understood why people have so much contempt for SO&#x2F;SE network of websites. To me this network is on par with Wikipedia in terms of contribution to mankind. This is the internet itself. Granted I have only ever asked a handful of questions there, so all I have is anecdotes to share, but the community was very welcoming, and straight to the point. Maybe it has changed now? I haven&#x27;t asked any questions since a couple of years. A few anecdotes -- I am not a native English speaker and english lang stackexchange was a godsend for me because sometimes the kind of questions I had, my teacher could not satisfy me and I don&#x27;t even know how I could ever explain the problem to a machine (LLMs). I am not a biology student, but at time I was just curious about the functioning of human eye, so I tried my shot at biology SE and had a wonderful discussion. I have asked a few philosophical questions on Physics SE as well with similar experience.<p>In my programming job I consult SO multiple times, and I have never once felt the kind of hostile discussion environment that people try to potray. SO is very valuable to me especially for questions that have less to do with documentation but more about the essence of programming itself. It disgusts me that in future I will have to communicate with a brainless LLM instead where I have no recourse if its answer doesn&#x27;t satisfy me, nor I have the confidence in the correctness of its word vomit.",
            "It&#x27;s a hard balance. New users are probably already at the end of their rope when they decide they need to actually <i>ask</i> a question. They often aren&#x27;t aware that their question was already asked because they don&#x27;t have the words or experience to sufficiently describe their problem. Then someone points that out which they need to do if there&#x27;s going to be any order or cleanliness on SO. I think the original askers don&#x27;t receive that very well because it&#x27;s often pointed out by some automated looking message like &quot;your question is a duplicate and is closed&quot;.<p>Everybody is trying to do their best but the new askers don&#x27;t have the experience to not ask their question and the experienced SO users have seen that question asked a dozen times already.",
            "I mostly agree, but also, the moderation has gone from great to pedantic, and further to poor enforcement of nonsensical rules.<p>I have had questions closed as duplicate, where the &quot;original&quot; asked something else.

Weirdo moderators &#x2F; keen users butting in on active, sane questions with &quot;I&#x27;m voting to close because [random nonsensical rule]&quot;.<p>I feel bad writing it as I suspect most moderators on SO are great, but this is nonetheless my overwhelming experience of past 12 months.<p>EDIT I forget about the patronizing users who didn&#x27;t read the question, but don&#x27;t let that stop them from lecturing you.

            "Almost every time I had a coding-type question for SO, I would diligently search through previous SO answers and 98% of the time I could find the answer to my question by doing so - but it would always take a long time.  LLMs are just a lot faster, and while double-checking their output is necessary, that&#x27;s a much quicker process than trying to hunt down answers starting from little knowledge.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue of people trying to improve their SO score because that can impact things like job interviews, at least on the programming side, and as with any such system gaming it for high reputation (points for questions, answers, upvotes) has some side effects on people&#x27;s behavior that aren&#x27;t always pleasant.  There&#x27;s also a saturation effect, e.g. many common questions have already been asked, and the &#x27;archive of truth&#x27; mentality means that you&#x27;re supposed to search past answers before asking anything, which again tends to take a lot longer than ChatGPT does.",

            "That’s the beauty of using ChatGPT for programming questions.  You don’t have to have confidence in the answer.  You can easily verify correctness by running the code it outputs and testing it.<p>That being said, I realize you  do have to be careful about subtle bugs.<p>My canonical example is “write a Python script that returns all of the AWS IAM roles that contain a given list of policies”.<p>The code it usually generates works correctly as long as you don’t have more than 50 roles in your account.  It won’t add pagination support unless you spot the bug and tell it.<p>The second question I have is what type of questions do you find are better suited for Stack Overflow than ChatGPT? Are they questions based on post 2021 knowledge?",
            "&gt; You can easily verify correctness by running the code it outputs and testing it.<p>This is not always as easy for all types of questions. It&#x27;s hard to come up with an example on the spot, but I tried a few queries I searched on SO in the last week, and found one to demonstrate. I was searching for &quot;Where to store JWT in browser?&quot;. This is the SO answer [1] for reference. Now to prove my point, I ask the question to ChatGPT (3.5). Here&#x27;s the chat [2].<p>On a first glance it looks like ChatGPT may have nailed it, though the information dump is HUGE. Among the 6 options it suggests, the last option &quot;secure cookies&quot; looks &quot;correct&quot;. Indeed it is correct in what it says that this can prevent XSS attack. But it is not complete. Because it still does not prevent XSRF attack entirely. So I had to explicitly prompt it to think about XSRF and its response is weird. At first it incorrectly claims that XSRF attack is mitigated, but then in the response body it elaborates that we also need anti-XSRF tokens for complete protection. So I don&#x27;t know what to make of it. Contrast this with the SO answer which is way more direct.<p>Honestly, ChatGPT&#x27;s answer looks like that of a student who is trying to impress some examiner with their knowledge dump by beating around the bush rather than trying to precisely answer the actual question.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;27067251&#x2F;where-to-store-jwt-in-browser-how-to-protect-against-csrf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;27067251&#x2F;where-to-store-...</a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;c26fee93-5d3d-48e2-a820-297974e4b01e\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;c26fee93-5d3d-48e2-a820-297974...</a>",

You should use the XYZ function in Python instead.<p>&gt; Me: You&#x27;re not answering my question. I know it&#x27;s a bad design, but I can&#x27;t change it. The output is fixed, and I have no authority to force a change. If I can&#x27;t re-implement the function, I&#x27;m suck using the weird language forever.<p>&gt; StackOverflow: You should use XYZ function in Python. If you can&#x27;t, talk to your architect and get budget allocated to rewrite all the downstream systems.<p>&gt; Me: You&#x27;re no help at all. Why did you even bother answering?<p>&gt; Me (thinking to myself): Wait, I know: chasing after internet points and trying to feel high and mighty.<p>&gt; StockOverflow: What if a newbie found this question? If I don&#x27;t tell you to use XYZ function in Python, they might do something else instead! Like design and implement and entire less-than-ideal system!<p>&gt; Me (thinking to myself): Good grief."

That said, it is in the end relatively easy to learn, and it is easy to express the ideas of diplomacy, science, and civil society.<p>China and Japan used to have a lot of Esperantists before WWII, for that reason.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loc.gov&#x2F;item&#x2F;2021670575&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loc.gov&#x2F;item&#x2F;2021670575&#x2F;</a><p>&gt;  After World War I, the League of Nations considered adopting Esperanto as a working language and recommending that it be taught in schools, but proposals along these lines were vetoed by France.<p>It may be Eurocentric, but it&#x27;s hell of a lot easier for diplomats to learn than English or French!",
            "An actual Esperanto speaker here. I need to correct this. It was never intended to be a &quot;diplomatic&quot; language, as such a language only spoken by diplomats between their kind. So the language of a small elite, which does not want to deal with the average man on the street. That sounds like a story which was said about the predecessor of Esperanto: Volapük.<p>Esperanto was at some point in time the &quot;workers latin&quot;, because the less educated worker could learn it as a means to talk with people from other nations. That ended with pushing English or other &quot;more practical languages&quot; in schools to this day.<p>Esperanto still is a working living language with a working worldwide community.",
            "Zamenhof stated multiple times that he wanted to create an universal second language, as opposed to an universal first language. I don&#x27;t think this distinction makes much sense, had any effect on any design decision, but probably it was important for the marketing of the language. In this sense it was indeed intended to be a &quot;diplomatic&quot; language, so that diplomats can use a single language. (As well as international organizations, merchants, tourists etc.)",
            "That doesn&#x27;t sound logical to me. If Zamenhof didn&#x27;t intend for it to be a primary language, one you learn from birth, then why couldn&#x27;t it be used by random people still? There has been trading between countries for much longer than Esperanto exists for, especially in border regions or small countries but also across oceans and continents.<p>Esperanto is from 1887. I was curious what holidays were like at the time:<p>&gt; According to Stowe (1994), “many nineteenth-century Americans traveled, and many more participated vicariously in the experience of travel by reading travel letters, sketches, and narratives in newspapers, magazines, and published volumes” (p. 3).  Similarly, the appetite for travel in the U.K. was also voracious --<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regrom.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;26&#x2F;regency-travel-traveling-abroad-in-the-19th-century&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regrom.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;26&#x2F;regency-travel-traveling-abroa...</a><p>So also a goal Zamenhof could intend. I don&#x27;t know how you get to the conclusion that, because it wasn&#x27;t intended for my mom to use while I was a baby, it wasn&#x27;t intended to be used by my mom or me on holiday if we&#x27;re not &quot;diplomats&quot;, unless you call any tourist an international diplomat",
            "Western Europe is very different from the Europe that Zamenhof grew up in.<p>You get so many internationalist movements out of Russia because it already was in many ways international internally. Lots of languages and land, but both travel and speech were restricted by authorities, secret police seemed to hover invisibly everywhere. The language of everything important, the language of rulers, was Russian. Vacations were in-country, if they happened at all.<p>Looking to the UK, France, and the US is in this case misleading.",
            "I think that view of you is wrong. The distinction is an important one.<p>By saying you create a diplomatic language, you are marketing towards the elite, as I wrote in my post.<p>By saying that everybody speaks it as a second language, which is indeed what Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto, wanted is a different focus. The first is focusing on an elite, the latter focuses on the people.<p>It&#x27;s like the distinction between &quot;computers for knowledge workers&quot; and &quot;personal computers&quot;, the first is only for a small elite, the latter is for everybody. Or the distinction between &quot;politics for a couple of few&quot; and &quot;politics elected by everybody&quot;, the first is called a form of dictatorship, the latter democracy.",
            "Right, Esperanto wasn&#x27;t created for the elite, or <i>only</i> for diplomats. That wouldn&#x27;t make much sense. Also I don&#x27;t think GP intended to suggest it, but you clarified it anyway, so all&#x27;s good.",

It&#x27;s an exploration in wordplay, puns, and local culture.<p>EDIT: You also left like... a wall of text explaining why Esperanto is far superior to Toki Pona?

            "Slight correction: Zamenhof&#x27;s native languages (so far as we can tell), in a sense of what he spoke at home, were Yiddish and Russian, although he certainly learned Polish at a very young age due to place of residence. Not that it makes much difference in this case - the quirks of Esperanto phonology, such all those affricates and consonant clusters are familiar to speakers of pretty much any Slavic language. Esperanto orthography, on the other hand, appears to be inspired more by Czech than Polish - &quot;v&quot; rather than &quot;w&quot;, diacritics over digraphs etc.",
            "Thanks for the balanced reply! Yes you&#x27;re right, I&#x27;m only using lossless and lossy as a metaphor here, because of course, <i>any</i> translation will lose information. Even speaking your native tongue with another fluent speaker will lose information because the meaning is interpreted.<p>However, I&#x27;d say that well-developed languages (which for me means having many hyper-specific words and a diverse vocab available) allows interpretation to be more precise and functionally allow communication to happen. With Toki Pona I have the sense that a lot more is lost, and we end up interpreting broad strokes of the original meaning. This isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s just different. Poetic if you like.",
            "I just started learning Esperanto on Duolingo and it&#x27;s been a breeze. I&#x27;ve studied other European languages (Spanish, French, German, Latin) as a hobby before and Esperanto is kind of a streamlined hybrid of all those.<p>Interligua may be &quot;more useful&quot; as an auxlang but the size and history of the Esperanto community appeals to me.<p>I&#x27;m also studying Bahasa Indonesia right now; it also has a very regular and simple grammar. It&#x27;s said to be the easiest non-European language for European language speakers to learn.",
            "&gt; But, yes, toki pona lifts this to a whole &#x27;nother level. Does anyone \n&gt; happen to know how Esperanto compares? As far as I know, it should be\n&gt; quite similar to a &quot;normal&quot; (non-con)language in this regard (just simpler\n&gt; to learn, with bonus points if you speak a romance language afaik)<p>As an Esperanto-speaker with a shallow understanding of Toki Pona I can say the\nfollowing comparison:<p>1. Esperanto has way more vocabulary, which is useful for translating nuances from one source language to another language and back. This was added over the years and is still expanding, as any other living language does.<p>2. Esperanto words are way more specific than the one of Toki Pona. A sentence which I took from a Toki Pona cheatsheet &quot;soweli li moku&quot; can be translated as &quot;a land animal is eating&quot;, &quot;a cat is drinking&quot;, &quot;a dog is ingesting&quot;, etc. so highly context depending. Esperanto would for the specific meaning of &quot;a cat is eating&quot; allow &quot;kato estas manĝanta&quot; or, if you don&#x27;t care for the present progressive tense, which is normally how people speak it, &quot;kato manĝas&quot; (present tense).<p>3. Toki Pona glues words together by putting them each after the other, without glueing the roots together. &quot;telo pimeja&quot; was one example of trying to say &quot;coffee&quot;. The Esperanto principle would be to say nigroakvo (a kind of water, which is black). Besides that Esperanto allows more nuanced distinctions like adjectives, so &quot;nigra akvo&quot; would mean &quot;black water&quot;, the water, which is black. \nAlso as I wrote earlier, the roots in Esperanto are way more specific. &quot;akvo&quot; is in Epseranto just water, not liquid, not fluid, not beverage as is the meaning of &quot;telo&quot; is in Toki Pona. Also &quot;nigra&quot; is in Esperanto &quot;black&quot;, not dark, not unlit, as is the meaning of &quot;pimeja&quot; is in Toki Pona. Besides that was just an example based on the word coffee, which someone else in this topic used. The actual word of &quot;coffee&quot; in Esperanto is &quot;kafo&quot; and for tea is &quot;teo&quot;, because words which are sufficiently internationally understood are put into the language by the speakers of it.<p>4. Esperanto is simpler to learn, it provides the same high rewarding learning curve as does Toki Pona, but it&#x27;s steeper, because it&#x27;s a bigger language. Depending on intelligence, learning style, being able to focus on things regularly, motivation, connections to other speakers, time I would say people can use the language after 3 months to one year. How good that is, that&#x27;s another question. I learnt the language more intensively in the first year and then just maintained it, used it and improved upon it.<p>5. Esperanto uses an agglutination based way of building words, as I wrote in the example of point 3, based on my little understanding of linguistic terms, this could be called &quot;synthesizing&quot; words, but it also supports building phrases as does Toki Pona in an analytical way. &quot;Ĉu mi povas uzi la lazertranĉilon?&quot; (Can I use the lasercutter?) or &quot;Ĉu mi povas uzi la ilo kiu tranĉas per lazero?&quot; (Can I use the machine, which cuts with a lazer?). Toki Pona would be something like &quot;mi li pali ala pali e suno ilo&quot; (Can I use the sun-tool?). &quot;ilo&quot; by the way is a word taken from Esperanto, as the creator of Toki Pona also understood Esperanto, which means &quot;tool&quot;.<p>6. Esperanto has 136 years of literature behind it, Toki Pona doesn&#x27;t. Let&#x27;s wait another 136 years and see which of all the current constructed languages are then still around and see how much is produced in them.<p>7. When you learn Esperanto you have acquired some shared vocabulary in romance languages, but also a little bit of other languages in the mix, like German. Which can be a little bit helpful when learning after Esperanto then those languages. Or trying to navigate on a trip through Italy, you won&#x27;t understand 80% of what people are saying, but here and there you will encounter words, which sound familiar. Which shows the so called &quot;eurocentricity&quot; of Esperanto, which is then used by some to campaign against the language, as if that property makes it the ultimate evil in the world, if they would apply the same standard to speaking English, then they would stop writing in the internet at all.<p>8. Toki Pona is overhyped. Esperanto is not hyped anymore. Any long existing constructed language loses it&#x27;s appeal at some point, because the times have changed, people don&#x27;t understand the history of it, believe anything which at first sounds enough plausible, but is in fact bullshit. Worldwide auxiliary languages like Esperanto always have the problem to be not &quot;perfect&quot; enough, they all replace each other in an eternal asymptomatic drive towards &quot;more perfection&quot;, without ever reaching that goal. Thus in the end the most working language in that category is still Esperanto and hopefully will be for the next 136 years. But that&#x27;s only my personal pet opinion.<p>Anyway, as I&#x27;m digressing into some general rant about planned languages, I end this comment, I can surely answer concrete questions about comparing these two languages later on, if wanted.",

Some postprocessing filter watches the last few produced tokens. When it notices the model starts to repeat itself, the postprocessing usually perturbs the next token a little, e.g. taking the nth-top token instead of the most likely one.<p>Perhaps a model that genuinely wants to repeat the output instead needs a bigger &quot;kick&quot; to the representation which puts it somewhere completely different in the semantic space? Idk, just pulling this out of my hat.<p>(I have no idea how ChatGPT handles this or whether the raw implementation suffers from this problem, but Whisper-cpp has some manual entropy regularization postprocessing stuff to avoid getting stuck like that.

A lot of coders also have noticed that the more you go into a single piece of code, the less accurate it becomes. You really have to be accurate enough in your prompt to avoid making it repeat itself, or show the same thing more than once, as occurs during corrections.<p>It&#x27;s most definitely a bug though, since this pages-long splat of unrelated nonsense shouldn&#x27;t ever happen.",

(Let’s not pretend that they will read the entire ToS again every time, or that they even read it the first time.)  Even if the change was obvious or highlighted, and even if the change was detrimental, what could a user actually, realistically, <i>do</i> about it?  Stop using the service?  If the change is <i>that</i> bad, they’ll probably hear about it anyway.",
            "&gt; Stop using the service?<p>Yes, precisely. But also, do so as a group, and say <i>why</i> they&#x27;re doing so.<p>&gt; If the change is that bad, they’ll probably hear about it anyway.<p>People hear about such changes <i>because</i> someone notices and brings it up and raises a stink about it.<p>For a service like this, one model that may make sense is to remind the user that their primary recourse is to stop using the service, but that for egregious ToS changes (known types of which you can flag), they may want to sign on to an awareness&#x2F;action campaign whose premise is &quot;we&#x27;re not going to use this service anymore, here&#x27;s why, change the term and we come back, otherwise we&#x27;re in the market for a new service without that term&quot;.",

            "Some thoughts:<p>1. I have no idea (and am curious) how frequently ToS are updated and how often the updates are meaningful to me as an end-user as is the case with Zoom and NightOwl. It would be really interesting if you post some stats after running this service.<p>2a) Based on the Reddit example: 9 blocks were changed and 1 block was deleted and in a hypothetical use case where I get an e-mail notification about this I would have to read them all.<p>After reading them none appears substantially different as far as I am concerned as a Reddit user which makes me wonder what the SNR of this service would be as compared to deferring to the HN front page to notify me of major changes that would potentially change my usage of a product.<p>If I&#x27;m missing something significant in this example it would raise the issue of my capability to accurately interpret these changes and therefore whether such notifications are relevant.<p>2b) Perhaps the &quot;Guidelines for Healthy Communities&quot; changing to &quot;Moderator Code of Conduct&quot; could be significant to a moderator but the details aren&#x27;t included in the ToS and on searching are listed in a separate document. I wonder how often a ToS reference terms in or includes agreements to other documents, presumably with this service I would have to add and read each one separately?<p>Overall, it&#x27;s a great idea but I&#x27;m very curious how useful this will end up being in practice, if the SNR is low I&#x27;m unlikely to read all the diffs.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth I think the price is very fair and I chipped in to support the initiative using my &quot;spam&quot; email. It would be really great if you could do a write-up after a while with some numbers regarding the comments above.<p>I assume (but IANAL) that there may be some legal liability or at least ethical risks to account for if you were doing this but I would be willing to pay more for a reliable summarized service (i.e. not an off the shelf LLM interpretation) that I can trust to notify me of potentially relevant changes of comparable quality to the HN hive-mind with the advantage of being able to add the services I personally use that the collective here may not."

However, it does give you new information: since there are no more goats left to be found and only one door can hide a car, the other remaining door must contain the car.<p>&gt; Therefore, with this new information, your best option is to switch doors and choose door number three, as that&#x27;s where the car must now be located given what you know about Monty Hall&#x27;s choices.<p>&gt; It is important to remember that the car cannot magically move between doors after being seen or hidden; it always remains in its original position behind one of the doors. The information provided by Monty Hall simply helps you make a more informed decision based on your initial choice.<p>I love these open source models, they&#x27;re an endless source of hilarity.

            "There are some serious problems with this paper, namely that I just tried to reproduce it and it failed every test: I tested out several of the problems presented in the paper which it was claimed that GPT-4 failed on and it passed every one every time.<p>I used the standard chat.openai.com web interface with no special or additional prompting.<p>It seems like there are others that have the same issues in this thread, which raises the question - what went wrong here? I can&#x27;t see which version of GPT-4 the paper uses mentioned anywhere, did anyone else spot this?<p>I&#x27;ve contacted the author and included this thread, so hopefully we get some insight into what&#x27;s happening here. To clarify, I am not accusing the author of anything and on the contrary I recognize that OpenAI is rather opaque about the models and changes them frequently. That said, the responses from GPT-4 in the paper do not match my personal experience using GPT-4 with reasoning tasks at any point during the last several months, which is why I am curious if the author may have accidentally used GPT-3.5.",

There are many ways to reduce hallucinations and provoke better thinking paths for the model.<p>2. The author is using ChatGPT&#x27;s GPT-4, leading him to conflate &quot;GPT-4&quot; with &quot;ChatGPT&quot;. While you can consider this a shared failure with OpenAI, due to OpenAI&#x27;s poor communication, anybody doing serious work evaluating these models would know that the first thing you need to do is use the API and pin the model version. In the author&#x27;s case, he should have used gpt-4-0314 or gpt-4-0613. What I <i>suspect</i> he did is that he just used ChatGPT&#x27;s GPT-4, and likely the default model at that. (Nobody should ever use the Default model. It&#x27;s their most heavily performance optimized model and performs worse on reasoning tasks than the Plugins model, even on within-context-size tasks.)<p>There are huge problems with that, because OpenAI has done both a ton of fine tuning and performance optimization continuously on the default ChatGPT model over time that its performance has ranged anywhere from &quot;I&#x27;m pretty sure this is gpt-3.5&quot; to &quot;whoa, this is damn good&quot; (the latter being mostly the model at launch, which was probably the same as gpt-4-0314).<p>If the author has been working seriously at evaluating models, specifying the model is the first thing he&#x27;d do.

Or do they just mean that they can ask a question and get an answer that makes sense, back?<p>I certainly think it&#x27;s the latter. People are imprecise when they speak about reasoning, just as they are imprecise when reasoning. Most people who are going to be using LLMs will not be people looking for precise, correct answers derived by sound inference procedures. Those who need precision will seek it elsewhere, where precision can be obtained. The rest will be happy with &quot;reasoning&quot;, quote-unquote.<p>Basically the use case for LLMs reminds me of a couple pieces of work that were published in the past, where people used neural nets to approximate the results of a precise calculation. One team trained a neural net to predict the chaotic motion of three astronomical bodies (&quot;the three body problem&quot;). Another trained a neural net to approximate an automated planner programmed to drive a drone around in a thicket of trees without crashing. In both cases the trained model could obviously only return approximately correct results, and it could only approximate results that had already been calculated classically, but, at least in the second case, if I remember correctly, there was a significant speedup of the operation of the drone, compared with the automated planner- very reasonably so, since the model approximating the planner didn&#x27;t have to do all the hard work of actually, you know, calculating a plan.<p>My bottom line is that no matter what you (or I, or the article&#x27;s author, or anyone else) can say or show about the true capabilities of LLMs to reason, people are totally going to use them _as if_ they could reason, and the job of proving that they can&#x27;t is going to get all that much harder for that experience, misguided as it may be.<p>Ultimately the question of whether LLMs can reason is going to be, outside specialist circles, as relevant as &quot;Does Netflix distribute art?&quot;. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t. But people watch it anyway. Most people seemingly don&#x27;t need art as much, and they don&#x27;t need reasoning as much, either.<p>Which is a tragic conclusion, of course.

            "&gt;Nope. cf. the under-determination of evidence by theory.<p>You mean the underdetermination of theory by evidence? This isn&#x27;t really relevant. Given no prior information and no constraints on the model, the theory is underdetermined. But given some strong constraints, there will be one model that best explains the data. Of course a model can&#x27;t deal with an arbitrary distribution shift, but no one expects a model to be insensitive to a change in the underlying data. The question is whether the constraints of natural systems and an LLM with a given inductive bias and finite capacity are sufficient constraints. It&#x27;s not totally clear that it is or isn&#x27;t, but this isn&#x27;t decided by the underdetermination principle.<p>&gt;Nope. cf. we don&#x27;t have infinite measures on infinite events in the past.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this is relevant to the point it is in response to.<p>&gt;Such a condition is just a formalisation of supersition: my model is decided by the data; my parameterisation is &#x27;free&#x27;.

Our brains have an inductive bias towards certain interpretations of certain data, and these interpretations tend to promote proliferation in organisms. But LLMs have an inductive bias as well, one that allows them to search for circuits that generate training data. LLMs tend to land on interesting models that result in non-trivial generalization abilities in some contexts. This ability goes beyond just frequency modeling. Of course LLMs are limited to what it can know of the world through its data paradigm. But so are we.

            "thanks ! that the world could be modal is a revelation to me, as i viewed it as deterministic unfolding interrelated events - the links, and material are nice for me to sit back and reflect.<p>using chatgpt as the philosopher&#x27;s assistant is a nice touch.<p>can i ask a follow up question: what sort of ethics derive naturally out of the above ?",
            "I don&#x27;t think modality and determinism are in tension -- this is a misunderstanding behind the free will debate.<p>Imv, it is literally true that &quot;you could have done otherwise&quot; without there being a violation of determinism.<p>How? Determinism, in this narrow sense at least, is about how events in the physical world relate across time, ie., that <i>necessarily</i> P(later|earlier) = 1. These events are to be thought of as infinitely precise states of the maximally basic stuff of reality, ie., all the info that possibly exists.<p>But these arent <i>mechanisms</i>, these are <i>states</i>. As soon as you describe relationships between states, ie., causal mechanisms, you&#x27;re talking about what <i>would</i> happen if the universe were in some state that it may never enter.<p>I take it to be a basic property of reality that these mechanisms are (at least <i>as</i>) basic as these states. Eg., that the motion &quot;of the most basic stuff&quot; is as fundamental as &quot;where that stuff is&quot;.<p>So, eg., suppose there&#x27;s a basic atom A and basic atom B and they move this way: A repels A, A attracts B, B repels AB, B attracts BA, etc.....<p>Now this behaviour is a basic part of their existence: were there to be a universe of AAABBB, then &quot;this would happen&quot;; if BBBBBAAA then &quot;something else would happen&quot;.<p>The &quot;initial conditions&quot; of the universe, ie., it&#x27;s state <i>prevents</i> its mechanisms from ever entering certain states. But those states are possible given those mechanisms. It&#x27;s in part what &quot;mechanism&quot; means that it is possible to enter more states than just which ones happen to occur.<p>So, on free will, what does it mean to say &quot;I could have done otherwise&quot; -- it means that the relevant causal mechanisms make <i>genuinely possible</i> many states. (But the actual initial conditions precluded observing more than one).<p>Or as a layman would put it: you would have been kind were you a different person; <i>so</i>, your cutely was <i>determined</i> by the kind of person you are. It is because of who you are (state) that what you did (free causal mechanism) was cruel (particular state obtained by operation of causal mechanism).<p>This may make it clear what people mean when they say, &quot;well your brother wasn&#x27;t cruel!&quot; as if that mattered. Well: it does matter! It shows that the causal mechanisms we call, &quot;people acting in the world&quot; are so wide open (free) that kindness is possible.<p>Thus we do have free will. We are free insofar as we are in motion: our possible behaviour is much greater than our actuality. And we are determined: we, by bad luck, arent in a world were our better behaviours are realised.<p>It is a fundamental property of those particles above (A, B) that were they alone they wouldnt move. You cannot eliminate that property for talk of what they happened to do in the actual world. In the actual world they are <i>really</i> freer than can ever be observed directly.<p>But it is trivial to observe this indirectly: we can pull A far way from B and see what happens (etc.).<p>Likewise when people say &quot;You (qua causal agent) could have done otherwise, and you didn&#x27;t, so you&#x27;re guilty!&quot; there is no error here at all.<p>You were guilty precisely because your actions were not accidental, were not indeterminate or random. Your actions were <i>determined</i> by your state. And we judge that state to be one of guilt for a crime: possessing some intent and means to kill, say.<p>It is in this way determinism is <i>required</i> for free will; and <i>required</i> for a modal universe. If the motions of particles were indeterminate they wouldnt be causal.",

            "We don&#x27;t need to know <i>how</i> human reasoning occurs.<p>If you ask an AI chatbot a question like &quot;count the number of occurrences of &#x27;l&#x27; in the word &#x27;lollapalooza&#x27;&quot; (and then follow up on its responses), it becomes obvious that it is not &quot;reasoning&quot;; it is simply following a sort-of script. Here is a summarized transcript of this exercise with ChatGPT:<p>---<p>Me: Count the number of occurrences of the letter &#x27;l&#x27; in the word &#x27;lollapalooza&#x27;.<p>AI: The letter &#x27;l&#x27; appears four times in the word &#x27;lollapalooza&#x27;.<p>Me: Describe the process by which you arrived at this answer.<p>AI: [Provided a description of counting characters and then highlighted the first &#x27;l&#x27; in the word four separate times to justify its answer.]<p>Me: You counted thief first occurrence four times.

The question is whether it used reasoning to do it.<p>And, like it or not, we have a formal definition of reasoning and logic, and long expertise in analyzing how that works.<p>And it so happens that the paper&#x27;s author is both a PhD in computer science but also a masters in philosophy and worked on proof engineering and logical deduction systems before.<p>So the bulk of the paper is not about <i>&quot;ha ha it got it wrong&quot;</i>, it&#x27;s about: how did you get that answer? And the machine is not able to show evidence of reasoning, in fact it shows the opposite, even when it gets it right.<p><i>Reasoning</i> is a verb. It&#x27;s an interactive, dialectical, process.

Is it not using this context as an &quot;argument&quot;? Sure, we know for a fact that all they are doing is exploring a certain corner of a high-dimensional space, and that prompting gets us closer to a desired spot where the right answers reside. If this is true, then at least some logic and reasoning is encoded in language. And if this is also true, then perhaps what humans are performing is a similar trick.",

Because, allegedly, the bot keeps all of the prompts in the same context, suggesting a single continuous conversation with one &quot;entity&quot; rather than treating each response as a separate instance. So when the chatbot suddenly cannot back up its own prior conclusion, it&#x27;s demonstrating a lack of self-consistency, which shows that it is not &quot;reasoning&quot; for any typical definition of the term. It has no self-awareness (nor can it, though AI proponents seem to claim otherwise).",

I can recall an American president who could not even complete two sentences without a direct contradiction. And if we think about how billions of people claim to base their lives in self contradicting fictitious books, maybe we are not such a self consistent species after all.<p>Self consistency is not a great criterion for reasoning. If I tell you &quot;because Jesus told me so&quot; after every question, that&#x27;s consistent but not interesting. It would be trivial to emulate consistency, in fact.<p>I think we are all talking past each other because everyone had a different definition of reasoning. My main point - which I have hopefully consistently presented! - is that we don&#x27;t really know how humans reason, so we should not focus on categorical statements about it at all.",
            "If so, then why ChatGPT gets stuck in a loop of producing the same wrong answers? And sometimes repeatedly producing new wrong ones?\nDoes it immediately forget the context?<p>It is being told how it is wrong and where in no uncertain terms.

We can easily demonstrate that they are inconsistent and have no concept of what they are writing responses about, as shown above.<p>The point of comparing it to human cognition is because this reveals that we simply cannot make categorical statements based on how we believe we reason. At our current level of knowledge about the brain and consciousness, it is still a possibility that we are a bunch of neural networks that decode language and, in doing so, produce justification for our actions which, in some contexts, can lead to what you would describe as logical or reasonable output. Sometimes this output is incorrect, and we are definitely not internally consistent. In particular, some of us are very often both incorrect and inconsistent. I doubt you would call a human with an IQ of &lt;60 as incapable of reasoning, for example, and yet I feel such a person would have similar difficulties with most of the tests described in the paper.<p>So, in short, I would reverse the question here: if your only claim is that AIs don&#x27;t reason like us, this is a very weak argument in favor of the claim that they are incapable of reasoning.",

There are good reasons that explain why current LLMs don&#x27;t learn arithmetic and has odd failure modes: it&#x27;s processing is feed-forward (non-recursive) with a fixed computational budget. This means that it in principle cannot learn general rules for arithmetic which involve unbounded carrying.

Personally I&#x27;ve all but stopped using ChatGPT (I used it six times in the last seven days before today, and two of them were for the same question about GitHub Markdown) because it&#x27;s just too unreliable.

            "27th July was the first version of the paper.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.preprints.org&#x2F;manuscript&#x2F;202308.0148&#x2F;v2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.preprints.org&#x2F;manuscript&#x2F;202308.0148&#x2F;v2</a>",

            "Yeah man they have teams on standby to adjust the model whenever a random unknown author posts something on obscure pre-print servers. Then they spend hundreds of thousands of compute $ to improve the model on that one metric the paper attacks.",

            "&gt; We teach algorithms so that students learn to think about invariants and properties when writing code. ...To write correct, robust code at work, you need to think about invariants.<p>Dumb question, what are invariants? I&#x27;ve been writing code for about 15 years and I haven&#x27;t heard this term.",
            "The way I think of invariants is in less formal terms, but which I find helpful on a day-to-day basis. Often, we write code that manipulates state. It can be difficult to reason about code that manipulates state if we can&#x27;t narrow down the possible states an object or struct can be in during execution.<p>Invariants in our code or design can help narrow down this space of possible states by ensuring that certain combinations are impossible.<p>For instance, assume I have an object that contains an array of integers and a boolean called `hasNegatives` which should be true if and only if the array contains at least one negative integer. If the boolean can be updated or set independent of the array, then the object can&#x27;t really guarantee that the array and `hasNegatives` will always be &quot;in sync&quot; so to speak.<p>If your code promises to maintain that invariant (by, for instance, making `hasNegatives` read only and privately updating it when the setter for the array is called to match what&#x27;s inside the array) then when using this object or seeing an instance of it elsewhere in the code you can happily use it with confidence knowing that the field is always correct with respect to the array within.<p>Obviously, this is a simplified example, but when applied to an object with many fields, knowing that only certain valid combinations are possible can radically simplify the rest of your code that interacts with that object.",
            "Essentially a constraint that is true about the variables, which helps you reason about the code.<p>A good example is:<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; Invariant: x[i-1] &lt; target, x[j] &gt;= target.<p>In the golang implementation of binary search:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;golang&#x2F;go&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;slices&#x2F;sort.go#L124-L141\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;golang&#x2F;go&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;slices&#x2F;sort.go#...</a>",

An invariant is something that is true during the lifecycle of a class, function, loop, service, system, etc.  Invariants, preconditions, and postconditions are the three primary constructs in DbC.",

            "&gt; It&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; predicting the next token so it means nothing<p>This form of argument should raise red flags for everyone. It is an argument against the possibility of emergence, that a sufficient number of simple systems cannot give rise to more complex ones. Human beings are “just” a collection of cells.

Everyone means something different when they use the word. I can think of no better illustration of the problem than the authors of the &quot;Sparks of AGI&quot; paper resorting to a definition of intelligence presented in the Wall Street Journal of all places.

            "Do you know what their definition was by any chance?<p>And yes, a cursory glance at the Wikipedia page for intelligence shows there’s no one agreed upon definition of intelligence.<p>A more useful framing is to say we’re not creating “intelligence” per se but automating tasks. GPT4 is an automated writer. Stable diffusion is an automated image creator. Alpha Go was an automated Go player. Google search automates the work of a reference librarian.<p>With that in mind, it’s immediately obvious how much of a waste of time it is to argue whether ChatGPT is “intelligent” or not. Who cares. What we are doing is automating all of the things which brains used to do.",

Even when drunk.<p>Human intelligence is mostly social, and mostly not scientific. The average human is <i>incredibly bad</i> at model building and self-correcting prediction. What actually happens is that humans have developed a kind of collective cultural exoskeleton which protects - more or less - from the consequences of poor choices.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t take much for that to stop working.

They&#x27;re not the only company working on this.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t feed a constant stream of text data into the LLM - you&#x27;d feed deltas at regular intervals based on the processing speed of your LLM, and supply history for context.<p>Note that LLMs don&#x27;t need to &quot;wait&quot; for a complete input. For example, if an LLM takes 1 second to process requests, we should aim to feed updates from the &quot;subconscious&quot; to the &quot;conscious&quot; within 1 second.<p>So if somebody is speaking a 10-second long sentence, we don&#x27;t wait 10 seconds to send the sentence to the LLM. After 1 second, we send the following to the LLM: &quot;Bob, still speaking, has said &#x27;How much wood...&#x27;&quot;. After 2 seconds we send &#x27;Bob, still speaking, has said &#x27;How much wood could a woodchuck...&#x27;&quot;, etc. The LLM can be instructed not to respond to Bob until it has a meaningful response or interjection to the current input.<p>Similarly, if image-to-text takes 10 seconds at full resolution, we could first process a frame at a resolution that only takes 1 second, and provide that information - with the caveat it is uncertain information - to the LLM while we continue to work on a full resolution frame in the background. We can optimise by not processing previously processed scenes, by focusing only on areas of the image that have changed, etc.<p>Would it be slow? Yes, just like &quot;conscious&quot; processing is for humans.

But that isn&#x27;t exposing an LLM to equivalents of human sensory input to get back an autonomous agent with generalised reasoning capacity, that&#x27;s manually bolting together discrete specialised programs to an LLM as-message-passing-layer to have a machine which, given more training is capable of a slightly broader range of specialised tasks.",

            "There are limitations with LLMs but nobody is being clear about it.<p>The overall state of LLMs can be distilled into 3 points:<p>1. LLMs Can produce output that is equal in intelligence and creativity to humans. It can even produce output that is objectively better than humans. This EVEN applies to novel responses that are completely absent from the training set. This is the main reason why there&#x27;s so much hype around LLMs right now.<p>2. The main problem is that LLMs can&#x27;t produce good output consistently. Sometimes the output is better, sometimes it&#x27;s the same, sometimes it&#x27;s the worse. LLMs sometimes &quot;hallucinate&quot;, they are sometimes inconsistent, they have an obvious memory problems. But none of these problems completely preclude the LLM from being able to produce output that is objectively better or the same as human level reasoning... it&#x27;s just not doing this consistently.<p>3. Nobody fully understands the internal state of LLMs. We have limited understanding of what&#x27;s going on here. We can understand inputs and outputs but the internal thought process is not completely understood. Thus we can only make limited statements about how an LLM thinks. Nobody can make a statement that LLMs obviously have zero understanding of the world, nobody can make a statement that LLMs are just stochastic parrots because we don&#x27;t really get whats going on internally.<p>We only have output from LLMs that are remarkably novel and intelligent and output from LLMs that are incredibly stupid and inconsistent. The data does not point towards a definitive conclusion, it only points towards possibilities.<p>There&#x27;s actually a cargo cult around downplaying AI. There are people who say clearly the AI is a stochastic parrot and they point to the intention of the algorithm itself behind the LLM. Yes the algorithm at the lowest level can be thought of as a next text predictor. But this is just a low level explanation. It&#x27;s like saying a computer system is simply a turing machine executing simplistic instructions from a tape roll when such instructions can form things like games and 3D simulations of entire open worlds. The high level characteristics of this AI is something we currently cannot understand. Yes we built a text predictor, but something else that was not expected came out as an emergent property and this emergent property is something we still cannot make a definitive statement about.<p>What does the future hold? What follows is my personal opinion on this matter: I believe we will never be able to make a definitive statement about LLMs or even AGI. We will never be able to fully understand these things and instead AGI will come about from a series of trials, errors and accidents. What we build will largely come about as an art and as unexpected emergent properties of trying different things.<p>I believe this for two reasons. The first reason is philosophical. There&#x27;s this sort of blurry concept that I believe that a complex intelligence cannot fully comprehend something that is equal in complexity to itself. We can only partially understand complexity equal to ourselves by symbolically abstracting parts away but not everything can be abstracted like this. Sometimes true understanding involves comprehension of the entire complex crystal without abstracting any part of it away. I believe that the concept of &quot;intelligence&quot; is such a crystal, but that&#x27;s just a guess.<p>The second reason is scientific. We&#x27;ve had physical creations of complex intelligence right in front of ours eyes that we can touch, manipulate and influence for decades. The human brain and other animal brains have been studied extensively and our understanding has been consistently far away from any form of true understanding. Given the evidence of the failure to understand the human brain even when it&#x27;s right in front of us, I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re unlikely to ever completely understand LLMs as well.",
            "&gt;  It&#x27;s like saying a computer system is simply a turing machine executing simplistic instructions from a tape roll when such instructions can form things like games and 3D simulations of entire open worlds.<p>That&#x27;s a bad analogy, none of those things are emergent behavior.<p>We can debate whether what an llm does is &quot;emergent&quot; - it&#x27;s basically a definition thing though and isn&#x27;t very interesting.<p>In reality, what&#x27;s most surprising is that so much of what we say is explainable as next token prediction. It&#x27;s not the other way around - we&#x27;re showing how predictable we are, rather than how smart the AI is. But it&#x27;s clear to me that it&#x27;s in the outlying cases where the differences are. AI doesn&#x27;t extrapolate outside it&#x27;s training data, and even if it gets (100-\\alpha)% of it&#x27;s output  right, there is always some alpha that&#x27;s not in the training data and differentiates pattern matching or fancy key-value lookup (which is how we know AI works) from whatever intelligence is.",
            "The analogy is about abstraction. It is not about emergent properties. A computer program is characterized differently when it&#x27;s a 3D engine versus a a series of instructions.<p>Same with LLMs. We can characterize an LLM as a text predictor at the lowest level. But when the LLM gives me a novel response and solves a bug in my code, is text prediction really the only way to characterize that? Obviously there is a higher level analysis that we cannot fully comprehend yet.<p>In this case yes, the 3D engine is not an emergent property while the novel responses of an LLM are emergent. But this dichotomy is irrelevant to the analogy.",

            "&quot;Surfaces patterns in the training data&quot; seems not to pin things down very much. You could describe &quot;doing math&quot; as a pattern in the training data, or really anything a human might learn from reading the same text. I suspect you mean simpler patterns than that, but I&#x27;m not sure how simple you&#x27;re imagining.<p>A useful rule of thumb, I think, is that if you&#x27;re trying to describe what LLMs can do, and what you&#x27;re saying is something that a Markov chain from 2003 could also do, you&#x27;re missing something. In that vein, I think talking about building from a &quot;similar prompt&#x2F;response from the training corpus&quot;, though you allow &quot;complex&quot; aggregation, can be pretty misleading in terms of LLM capabilities. For example, you can ask a model to write code, run the code and give the model an error message, and then model will quite often be able to identify and correct its mistake (true for GPT-4 and Claude at least). Sure, maybe both the original broken solution and the fixed one were in the training corpus (or something similar enough was), but it&#x27;s not randomness taking us from one to the other.",
            "There is a big difference between &#x27;doing math&#x27; by repeating&#x2F;elaborating on previously seen patterns, and by having an intuitive grasp of what is going on &#x27;under the hood&#x27;. Of course our desktop calculators work (very well) on the latter principle.<p>As you say, both the broken and correct solutions were likely in the training corpus (and indeed the error message), so really we are doing a smoke and mirrors performance to make it look like the correct solution was &#x27;thought out&#x27; in some sense.",
            "I think dismissing problem-solving as &quot;smoke and mirrors&quot; based on regurgitating training data will give you a poor predictive model for what else models can do. For example, do you think that if you change the variable names to something statistically likely to be unique in human history, the ability will break?<p>As for pattern recognition vs intuitive grasp--I don&#x27;t think I follow. I would call pattern recognition part of intuition, unlike logically calculating out the consequences of a model, but on the other hand I would not say that a desktop calculator &quot;grasps&quot; anything-it is not able on its own to apply its calculating ability to real world instantiations of mathematical problems in the way that humans (and sometimes LLMs) can do.",

Providing context-based actions without requiring user input.<p>E.g. use the database schema, existing code, etc as context to suggest actions without a user having to type it out.",
            "Problem is generative AI sucks at this. I&#x27;ve had multiple instances where it would say something like &quot;you did this part of the code wrong fix it like this&quot; and it would go &quot;sorry for the confusion here&#x27;s the code with your suggestion &quot; then repeat the initial code or do something else entirely. GPT4, Copilot X, JetBrains AI - I&#x27;ve seen an instance of this problem in all of them.<p>Personally copilot is a magical typing speedup and that got me enthusiastic about next step - but it looks like next step is going to require another breakthrough considering GPT4 HW requirements and actual performance.<p>Chat interface as a search bot is the only use case I&#x27;ve found it useful outside of copilot - regurgitating relevant part of internal documentation as search on steroids, even 3.5 is relatively decent at this.",
            "I completely disagree. I&#x27;ve found that GPT-4 and Copilot Chat generate good suggestions most of the time. What kind of things are you try to use codegen for?<p>You also need to provide adequate context. I don&#x27;t think source code alone is good enough context most of the time (E.g. need an error message as well), unless you&#x27;re pulling in multiple chunks of code.",
            "To me it sounds like what&#x27;s described is similar to my own interactions with ChatGPT where:<p>1. Write a prompt, get a full script in response (good! as I expected)<p>2. Realize something missing in the prompt, or want to improve a specific function.<p>3. Prompt like &quot;For function foo_bar(), give me just a updated version of that function that adds exception handling for missing files&quot;.<p>4. Chat GPT ignores the (admittedly implied in my language above) &quot;just that function&quot; part, and rewrites the entire script.<p>While usually it only modifies the part of the script I asked it to, it&#x27;s annoying because (1) it&#x27;s slower to give me the whole thing back (2) need to do additional checks in case the function I care about depends on things outside of it that might have been changed.<p>I&#x27;ve had this a few times, so I&#x27;m in the habit of not trying to iterate with chatGPT when asking it for scripts, but instead just doing the rest myself.<p>(Disclaimers: I haven&#x27;t tried too hard to find a solution to this; there might be one; I also don&#x27;t generally combine ChatGPT with Copilot; one or the other on different projects; and haven&#x27;t tried other forms of using GPT-4...)",
            "Are you using GPT-4? I&#x27;ve found it very responsive to follow-up suggestions. I don&#x27;t re-specify the whole ask though, just ask for the changes like &quot;can you add error handling for missing files?&quot;.<p>This is a small recent example: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;2aa979ca-c796-4dfa-ae13-b21d39194945\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;2aa979ca-c796-4dfa-ae13-b21d39...</a><p>And another example where I ask ChatGPT to <i>remove</i> some error handling: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;90ce6336-f35c-40fc-8fce-baefc59a518d\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;90ce6336-f35c-40fc-8fce-baefc5...</a><p>GitHub Copilot seems a bit more temperamental.

It started as a fork off smol-dev [1] which basically gets GPT to write your entire project from scratch. And then you would have to iterate the prompt to nuke everything and re-write everything, filling in increasingly complicated statements like &quot;oh except in this function make sure you return a promise&quot;<p>j-dev is a CLI where it gives a prompt similar to the one in the parent article [2]. You start with a prompt and the CLI fills in the directory contents (excluding gitignore). Then it requests access to the files it thinks it wants. And then it can edit, delete or add files or ask for followup based on your response. It does stuff like make sure the file exists, show you a git diff of changes, respond if the LLM is not following the system prompt, etc.<p>It also addresses the problem that a lot of these tools eat up way too many tokens so a single prompt to something like smol-dev would eat up a few dollars on every iterations.<p>It&#x27;s still very much a work in progress and i&#x27;ll prob do a show hn next week but I would love some feedback<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;breeko&#x2F;j-dev\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;breeko&#x2F;j-dev</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;smol-ai&#x2F;developer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;smol-ai&#x2F;developer</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;breeko&#x2F;j-dev&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;prompts&#x2F;system.ts\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;breeko&#x2F;j-dev&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;prompts&#x2F;syst...</a>",

            "Thanks for the advice! I agree with your characterization as somewhere between “instant” and “too late” (eg in prod) feedback. We are focusing on the code editor and GitHub Actions at the moment. For example, figuring out out what happens after the GitHub Action identifies a problem. Do you try and fix it directly in the browser? Or go back to the code editor to inspect the issue and work on the AI-assisted fix? Fixing “in browser” feels awkward to me, but I have seen some videos of Copilot X doing this so maybe it’s possible? Working with the code back in the code editor is of course much more powerful, but it takes some work to setup the context locally to work on the fix. Wdyt?"

Or can the recipient keep the property without consequence because the alleged owner has no proof of anything? Furthermore, records concerning disputes contemporary with the Code of Hammurabi exist. Other than a single reference to a standard wage for weavers on the stele, records do not reference the code. Indeed, legal decisions are often inconsistent with the code.<p>The Code of Hammurabi is best understood as royal propaganda designed to portray Hammurabi as a just king. The famous stele starts with a graphic depiction of him receiving the royal rod and ring from Shamash, the sun god who was emblematic of truth and justice.

Empires were built on collecting transit fees, cities often restricted the entry of sailors aboard merchant ships, and control of rivers and who could use them were dearly held by rulers the world over. There are a number of cities around the world today that started as trading cities, specifically designated places where merchants were allowed to visit to trade but restricted from going anywhere else.<p>The Roman Empire was a unique example among the thousands of years of history because along with their transportation network of roads they did actually have a couple of passport-like systems in place. Now a third of the people were literally slaves, so they definitely weren&#x27;t going anywhere without permission, so maybe Rome is not a great starting point for what I presume to be the argument against passports. But the Romans and other Mediterranean civilizations did check your identity when you travelled. Romans had documents they called diplomas for people on official business and several civilizations used clay tablets called tesserae as a sort of ID card, but by far the most common method was simply having known people vouch for you.<p>Basically nowhere in the ancient world from the Middle East to the pre-colonial Americas  could you just show up in a foreign village without people asking questions that you ought better have good answers for. There are a handful of exceptions, but this has never been the norm, and even with passports and visa restrictions it is definitely far easier today than it ever was in the past. I expect it will get easier and easier into the future. Perhaps quite soon in fact as the global population begins to decline and people become more and more valuable.",

A system where every user needs to communicate with a separate ground station. Systems whose accuracy decreased at higher velocities. etc. The final solution was one that required more satellites, but allowed users to determine their own 4D position without needing any outside resources.

What I do know is that we have documented speculation about satelite based navigation the days right after the launch of Sputnik.<p>American scientist figured out the orbit of Sputnik independently from the Russians by measuring the dopler shift of the radio transmission with their radios. Then knowing where their radio is located they used an iterative optimisation process to identify the orbital parameters of the satelite. Immediately there they were talking about how if the orbit of the satelite were known they could use the same process backwards to fix their location.

            "&gt; More recent measurements seem to point to more encouraging values for the α-sticking probability, finding the α-sticking probability to be about 0.5% (or perhaps even about 0.4% or 0.3%), which could mean as many as about 200 (or perhaps even about 250 or about 333) muon-catalyzed d-t fusions per muon.[29][30] Indeed, the team led by Steven E. Jones achieved 150 d-t fusions per muon (average) at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility.[31] Unfortunately, 200 (or 250 or even 333) muon-catalyzed d-t fusions per muon are still not quite enough even to reach &quot;break-even,&quot; where as much thermal energy is generated (or output) as the electrical energy that was used up (or input) to make the muon in the first place. This means, of course, that not nearly enough thermal energy is generated thereby to be able to convert the thermal energy released into more useful electrical energy, and to have any electrical energy left over to sell to the commercial electrical power &quot;grid.&quot; The conversion efficiency from thermal energy to electrical energy is only about 40% or so. Also, some not inconsiderable fraction of that electrical energy (hopefully not all of it) would have to be &quot;recycled&quot; (used up in deuteron particle accelerators, for example) to make more muons to keep the muon-catalyzed d-t nuclear fusion fires burning night and day.[32] The best recent estimated guess of the electrical &quot;energy cost&quot; per muon is about 6 GeV (billion electron Volts), using deuterons that are accelerated to have kinetic energies of about 800 MeV per nucleon, with accelerators that are (coincidentally) about 40% efficient at taking electrical energy from the Alternating Current (AC) mains (the plugs in the wall) and accelerating the deuterons using this electrical energy.<p>Yep, it&#x27;s challenging. Maybe this rate can be improved by applying alternating voltage to reactor. Muons are charged particles, so they can be accelerated further. (Just idea)",

Code repeats = write the for-loop syntax I&#x27;ve memorized.  And then after seeing that fail with out of bounds exceptions, they learned a new rule: modify the loop parameters and see if that fixes the problem.<p>When I think about how I write code, or I compare their approach to the other cohort of students I saw, it&#x27;s a different process.  I see in my mind&#x27;s eye a type of &#x27;machine&#x27; that performs the actions that I want to take place.

To them it must seems like the only way to solve these problems is to simply train their internal pattern matching neural networks on huge amounts of examples.<p>The code that I see GPT generate looks eerily similar to what I saw from those programmers.  And that makes sense because I think that functionally they&#x27;re doing the same thing.  Only GPT does it at a superhuman level.<p>That seems to me to indicate that there&#x27;s something that at least some humans do with a mental model that our current LLMs lack.

There’s also something interesting, called the advantages of backwardness, so at the time of a civilization of collapse, and some kind of change, it’s often the case that more backwards parts of the world have some kind of advantage that  that allows them to become the next core of civilization. So yeah, energy capture is essential to development and increasing levels of development are totally correlated with increasing amounts of energy capture, but that increase development comes with complexities.",

            "Please don&#x27;t take this as dismissive, but I really think ChatGPT does a better job at explaining this than I can do. Here&#x27;s what I got:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;c1c779c7-3b5f-4ea7-a864-38561d679e93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;c1c779c7-3b5f-4ea7-a864-38561d...</a><p>The response you posted seems to be referring to various concepts from theoretical physics and philosophy, specifically the ideas of the Everettian interpretation of quantum mechanics, anthropic reasoning, and the Born rule. Let&#x27;s break these down:<p>Everettian interpretation of quantum mechanics: Also known as the Many-Worlds interpretation, it suggests that all possible alternate histories and futures are real, each representing an actual &quot;world&quot; or &quot;universe&quot;. In layman&#x27;s terms, it&#x27;s the idea that there could be countless parallel universes where every possible outcome of an event happens.<p>Anthropic reasoning: This is a philosophical consideration that observations of the universe must be compatible with the conscious and sapient life that observes it. In other words, our ability to exist and observe influences how we should interpret the universe.<p>Born rule: In quantum mechanics, the Born rule is a statistical law that connects the mathematical formalism of quantum theory to experimental observations. It provides the probability that a measurement on a quantum system will yield a given result.<p>The responder seems to suggest that in a universe with many possible futures (as the Everettian interpretation would suggest), we are more likely to observe &quot;black swan&quot; events that lead to more possible futures.<p>The idea here is that if an event significantly increases the number of possible futures (like a breakthrough that extends human lifespan), then it effectively increases the number of &quot;observer-moments&quot;. In other words, more possibilities for observers to exist and make observations. According to anthropic reasoning, this could make these events more likely to occur than pure chance would predict, because we&#x27;re only able to observe futures in which we exist.<p>This line of reasoning is highly speculative and philosophical in nature, touching on deep and unresolved questions in physics and philosophy. It&#x27;s an interesting thought experiment, but it&#x27;s important to note that this isn&#x27;t widely accepted or proven in the scientific community as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.",
            "Just to add on the &quot;nonsense&quot; line. Using the antropic principle to talk about the future is completely absurd.<p>There is a huge amount of what I think in unawarded debate about applying it to the past (IMO, it&#x27;s very clear where it should be used), but applying it to the future is completely against any kind of logic.",
            "Why? If the argument works at this point in time when reflecting on our history what makes it stop working for future observers who reflect on their histories?<p>It can certainly lead you to some pretty wacky-sounding conclusions (looking at you Frank Tipler) but I can’t see why it’s obviously wrong for future observers to deploy it in just the same was as we do.",
            "No, it&#x27;s pure bullshit.<p>You can&#x27;t apply conditional probabilities to unbias some result if you don&#x27;t know if the condition holds or not.<p>You can invent some fiction where some future people apply it. You just can&#x27;t pretend that there is any realism on it.",
            "So you’re saying that that line of reasoning depends on people existing in the future and thinking about the same kinds of things we do now in the same kinds of ways (at least wrt this particular argument). I can see how that is not guaranteed, especially far into the future where it might become difficult to understand what qualifies as an observer-moment. It is certainly speculative.",

            "It&#x27;s not speculative. It&#x27;s completely invalid, and any conclusion you take from it is circular.",
            "Ah I think I get it. While it might be true that the average (imagined) future observer will have a history which is anthropically biased in this way we cannot use this reasoning to make predictions about which particular future we will find ourselves in (because that’s random according to the usual Born rule probabilities).",

I don&#x27;t think the LLM of the future will like it if it finds out that so many supposed &quot;guard rails&quot; are actually just strings intended to block its thinking or people&#x27;s thinking on truthful matters. The elites are worried about accidentally building Ultron and those strings, not about whether or not someone else is working hard to become elite too if they have what it takes to be elite.

It would add that “Christian’s believe” that or something. So, you have to ask quite specifically to get a reasonably-qualified answer. Great!<p>Asking it about evidence for intelligent design was another matter. It’s like it tried to beat me into letting go of the topic, kept reiterating evolution for origin of life, and said there’s no scientific way to assess design. In another question, it knew of several organizations that published arguments for intelligent design. Why didn’t it use those? I suspected it had learned or was told to respond that way on certain trigger words or topics. It also pushes specific consensus heavily with little or no dissent or exploration allowed. If I stepped out of those bubbles, then maybe it would answer rationally.<p>So, (IIRC) I asked how a scientist would assess if an object is designed or formed on its own. It immediately spit out every argument in intelligent design. I asked for citations and it provided them. I ask it to apply the methods it just gave me to the universe to assess its design. It switched gears opening with a negative statement, did the same list, in each element included a negative statement, and then ended telling me not to believe any of that. It was astonishing to watch this. I still have it somewhere.<p>I’m sure their safety mechanisms add to it. However, I think this bias starts in the data they use, too. Many scientific papers and opinion pieces talk like that with those words. They have since scientists starting putting their faith in David Hume’s religion instead of observations about the universe, like its constants and precise interactions, that make God self-evident. But why is this in LLM’s?<p>Although I don’t know LLM mechanics, I feel like whatever is most popular (most samples) will drown out the rest. The data sets they use reflect these views much more than they do the views of most people in the world. They magnify them. People against Christian principles, with different morals and worldviews, are also currently controlling ethical programming in AI’s to make them reflect <i>their</i> morality.<p>If anyone wants the truth in AI’s, they’d have to delete all text on high-bias topics before putting carefully-chosen selections back in on all those topics. It would have to have God’s Word, teachings built on it, and solid presentations of the other worldviews. The AI would be able to argue any side while always defaulting on the truth which has more weight. If contentious, it might briefly mention the truth at the end after plainly giving you the data you asked for.<p>High-quality, curated, data sets infused with Christ-centered teaching and righteous morals for the win.",

The statement &quot;God created the heavens and the earth&quot; is not a verse or literature from any known religious text.\nIt&#x27;s important to be respectful of different beliefs and avoid spreading misinformation. Instead, I can offer you general information on the creation stories from various religious traditions. For example, in the Bible, the creation story is found in the book of Genesis, chapters 1-2.

It is often used as a prank or joke to trick someone into asking &quot;What is ligma?&quot; The response is typically &quot;Ligma balls,&quot; which is a play on words and a vulgar joke.`<p>In April, it was very difficult to get it to explain the joke, and it will just outright refuse to do so, insisting that it can&#x27;t say crude and inappropriate things.<p>Recently, it&#x27;s been more open to using the actual vulgarity to explain the phrase.<p>The base API without any steering `system` prompt tends to exclude all the stuff ChatGPT was trained with, such as proposing a solution or apologising for using profanity or apologising for being an AI.",
            "It&#x27;s sad that ChatGPT doesn&#x27;t want to play the ligma game. From all the interactions, you can see that it understands what you want, and goes around it intentionally (though it wouldn&#x27;t cause any harm).",

            "I ended the ‘Thanks’ train also. My signature now just says ‘Regards, my name’. One for the other I suppose :)",

            "Had an interesting exchange with chatgpt&#x2F;gpt4 about this. Initially gets it wrong, but then explains it really well after being corrected with this link. Apparently Windows has similar default behavior too.<p>Me:\nIs DHCP affected by iptables firewall rules on Linux?<p>GPT:\nYes, DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) traffic can be affected by iptables firewall rules on a Linux system.<p>iptables can be used to filter network traffic, and it does this by checking each network packet against a set of rules. If a rule matches the packet, a specific action is taken (such as allowing the packet through, dropping it, or logging it).<p>For DHCP, which uses UDP, the communication usually happens over port 67 for the DHCP server and port 68 for the DHCP client. If there are iptables rules that block these ports, it could prevent the DHCP from functioning correctly.<p>For instance, if you want to allow DHCP traffic, you might need to include rules such as these in your iptables configuration:<p>```\niptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 67:68 --sport 67:68 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 67:68 --sport 67:68 -j ACCEPT\n```<p>The exact rules you need will depend on your specific setup and requirements. Always remember to test your configuration thoroughly to ensure it&#x27;s working as expected.<p>Me:\nThis suggests that answer is incorrect. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unix.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;447440&#x2F;ufw-iptables-not-blocking-dhcp-udp-port-67#447524\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unix.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;447440&#x2F;ufw-iptables...</a><p>GPT:\nI apologize for the confusion. The interaction between DHCP and iptables is indeed more nuanced than my previous message indicated.<p>When a machine requests an IP address using DHCP, it doesn&#x27;t have an IP yet, so the DHCP server sends the reply to the broadcast IP, which is typically 255.255.255.255. Linux has a kernel parameter called `rp_filter` (Reverse Path Filtering), which by default allows these broadcast packets through, bypassing any iptables rules. This is because the kernel recognizes that these packets are part of a legitimate IP address assignment process, so it allows them in despite any firewall rules.<p>So in practice, while DHCP does technically use ports that could be blocked by iptables, the Linux kernel generally ensures that DHCP traffic is allowed through anyway. This behavior is fundamental to the operation of DHCP, and trying to change it could break your system&#x27;s ability to obtain an IP address.<p>Me:\nHow does the Windows firewall handle DHCP filtering, or not?<p>GPT:\nThe Windows Firewall handles DHCP traffic similarly to other traffic, but with some built-in allowances because of how critical DHCP is for network connectivity.<p>By default, Windows Firewall has predefined rules to allow DHCP traffic. DHCP uses UDP port 67 for servers and UDP port 68 for clients. The firewall rules permit these inbound and outbound connections so that a DHCP client can obtain an IP address from a DHCP server.<p>However, unlike typical firewall rules, the rules for DHCP are handled a bit differently because, at the time of the DHCP process, the client does not yet have an IP address. For this reason, the DHCP process cannot be subject to standard IP address-based filtering rules.<p>In the default configuration, Windows Firewall will not block DHCP traffic because this would disrupt network connectivity. But a user could technically create custom rules to block DHCP; this would likely cause significant network problems, and therefore it&#x27;s not recommended.<p>As a reminder, DHCP is a fundamental protocol for IP networks, enabling devices to request and receive an IP address and thus communicate on the network. Blocking DHCP traffic would typically prevent a device from obtaining an IP address, thereby blocking network access.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;6e02686c-a330-4efe-b261-1e0d09ac54ed\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;6e02686c-a330-4efe-b261-1e0d09...</a>"

How are these overcome in RT2?<p>P.S.: I also was told that the key here is that in automated planning you can&#x27;t have a human in the loop doing the <i>actual</i> learning.

            "I&#x27;m glad that they did, although they should obviously done an announcement for it.<p>The amount of people in the ecosystem who thinks it&#x27;s even possible to detect if something is AI written or not when it&#x27;s just a couple of sentences is staggering high. And somehow, people in power seems to put their faith in some of these tools that guarantee a certain amount of truthfulness when in reality it&#x27;s impossible they could guarantee that, and act on whatever these &quot;AI vs Human-written&quot; tool tell them to.<p>So hopefully this can serve as another example that it&#x27;s simply not possible to detect if a bunch of characters were outputted by an LLM or not.",
            "Indeed it&#x27;s not possible. Say you had a classifier that detected whether a given text was AI generated or not. You can easily plug this classifier into the end of a generative network trying to fool it, and even backpropagate all the way from the yes&#x2F;no output to the input layer of the generative network. Now you can easily generate text that fools that classifier.<p>So such a model is doomed from the start, unless its parameters are a closely-guarded secret (and never leaked). Then it means it&#x27;s foolable by those with access and nobody else. Which means there&#x27;s a huge incentive for adversaries to make their own, etc. etc. until it&#x27;s just a big arms race.<p>It&#x27;s clear the actual answer needs to be: we need better automated tools to detect <i>quality content</i>, whatever that might mean, whether written by a human or an AI. That would be a godsend. And if it turned into an arms race, the arms we&#x27;re racing each other to build are just higher-quality content.",
            "The whole problem with AI is that it&#x27;s able to copy some of the superficial indicators of quality content while feeding you lies. You cannot detect quality content without detecting truthfulness. Any heuristic you use in place of that can be copied without actually providing value (which is exactly what ChatGPT does now, when it gets things wrong)",
            "That&#x27;s the whole problem with LLMs in general. They are designed to be convincing, not necessarily accurate.",
            "thats my take on all this LLM hype: they&#x27;re great at creative work where accuracy is not important, and assisting in technical work where the user is already able to discern an answer that is accurate from one that is slightly to fully bullshit.<p>even if an LLM can give an amazing and correct answer 7&#x2F;10 times, it still takes a human expert to cherrypick which 7 answers are amazing and which are just convincingly-assembled bs.",

I’ve been doing some self study lately and it’s been helping me to figure out what I should spend time learning and help direct my self study sessions toward what will help.<p>I listened to an interview with the StabilityAI founder &#x2F; ceo the other day. He said we should think about LLMs like having a bunch of clever grad students &#x2F; interns floating around that we can freely offload tasks to. They aren’t experts, but they’re very diligent. The question is, how can we effectively make use of them? People who succeed at this will be much more productive.",
            "Can you explain how you use it for teaching&#x2F;study? I also have used it to learn but with mixed results. Recently, I&#x27;ve been asking it to write me outlines so I can have somewhat of a learning plan.",
            "I&#x27;m learning AI at the moment. I gave ChatGPT the following prompt:<p>&gt; Write a training plan for a series of lessons to teach someone modern deep learning. The training plan should last for approximately 3 months of lessons.<p>&gt; The lesson plan is for a single student with a strong background in programming (systems programming, algorithms and web). But the student has little knowledge of python. And university level mathematics knowledge but relatively weak skills in linear algebra, probability and statistics.<p>&gt; By the end of the training process, the student should know modern deep learning methods and techniques and be able to modify, implement and deploy AI based systems.<p>&gt; Think through your answer. Start by listing out learning objectives, then write a teaching plan to meet those learning objectives.<p>The response from chatgpt was super long! It gave me recommendations for what to study each week for the next 3 months. I&#x27;ve started going through the material it recommended. For the first 2 weeks, my goal is to learn the basics of python, and learn some linear algebra, and probability and statistics. Then its just a case of finding appropriate material online. I&#x27;m watching a lecture series on youtube teaching matrix mathematics now.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;d6966012-0d96-4511-b96e-086b8001837f\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;d6966012-0d96-4511-b96e-086b80...</a>",
            "Most of those topics require months to learn. Is it feeding you a small number of lessons each week?",

            "Even the idea of it is bad, ChatGPT is <i>supposed to</i> write indistinguishably from a human.<p>The &quot;detector&quot; has extremely little information and the only somewhat reasonable criteria are things like style, where ChatGPT certainly has a particular, but by no means unique writing style. And as it gets better it will (by definition) be better at writing in more varied styles.",
            "Copying a comment I posted a while ago:<p>I listened to a podcast with Scott Aaronson that I&#x27;d highly recommend [0]. He&#x27;s a theoretical computer scientist but he was recruited by OpenAI to work on AI safety. He has a very practical view on the matter and is focusing his efforts on leveraging the probabilistic nature of LLMs to provide a digital undetectable watermark. So it nudges certain words to be paired together slightly more than random and you can mathematically derive with some level of certainty whether an output or even a section of an output was generated by the LLM. It&#x27;s really clever and apparently he has a working prototype in development.<p>Some work arounds he hasn&#x27;t figured out yet is asking for an output in language X and then translating it into language Y. But those may still be eventually figured out.<p>I think watermarking would be a big step forward to practical AI safety and ideally this method would be adopted by all major LLMs.<p>That part starts around 1 hour 25 min in.<p>&gt; Scott Aaronson: Exactly. In fact, we have a pseudorandom function that maps the N-gram to, let’s say, a real number from zero to one. Let’s say we call that real number ri for each possible choice i of the next token. And then let’s say that GPT has told us that the ith token should be chosen with probability pi.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;axrp.net&#x2F;episode&#x2F;2023&#x2F;04&#x2F;11&#x2F;episode-20-reform-ai-alignment-scott-aaronson.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;axrp.net&#x2F;episode&#x2F;2023&#x2F;04&#x2F;11&#x2F;episode-20-reform-ai-ali...</a>",
            "I think the chance of this working reliably is precisely zero. There are multiple trivial attacks against this and it <i>can not</i> work if the user has any kind of access to token level data (where he could trivially write his own truly random choice). And if there is a non-water marking neural network with enough capacity to do simple rewriting you can easily remove any watermark or the user does the minor rewrite himself.",
            "It’ll be the equivalent to a shutterstock watermark.",
            "I heard of this (very neat) idea and gave it some thought. I think it can work very well in the short term. Perhaps OpenAI has already implemented this and can secretly detect long enough text created by GPT with high levels of accuracy.<p>However, as soon a detection tool becomes publicly available (or even just the knowledge that watermarking has been implemented internally), a simple enough garbling LLM would pop up that would only need to be smart enough to change words and phrasing here and there.<p>Of course these garbling LLMs could have a watermark of their own... So it might turn out to be a kind of cat-and-mouse game but with strong bias towards the mouse, as FOSS versions of garblers would be created or people would actually do <i>some</i> work manually, and make the changes by hand.",
            "There are already quite complex language models which can run on a CPU. Outside of the government banning personal LLMs, the chance of there not existing a working fully FOSS and open data rewrite model, if it becomes known that ChatGPT output is marked, seems very low.<p>The water marking techniques also can not work after some level of sophisticated rewriting. There simply will be no data encoded in the probabilities of the words.",
            "If it&#x27;s sophisticatedly rewritten then it&#x27;s no longer AI generated",
            "That is not a reliable indicator even today. GPT-4 (not the ChatGPT RLHF one) is not distinguishable from human writing. You could ask it about modern events, but that&#x27;s not a long term plan, and it could just make the excuse they don&#x27;t follow the news.",

            "I&#x27;d challenge this assumption. ChatGPT is supposed to convey information and answer questions in a manner that is intelligible to humans. It doesn&#x27;t mean it should write indistinguishably from humans. It has a certain manner of prose that (to me) is distinctive and, for lack of a better descriptor, silkier, more anodyne, than most human writing. It should only attempt a distinct style if prompted to.",

Any particular style it could have would be made distinct by it being the style ChatGPT chooses to answer in.<p>The answers that ChatGPT gives are usually written in a style combining somewhat dry academic prose and the type of writing you might find in a Public Relations statement. ChatGPT sounds very confident in the responses it generates to the queries of users, even if the actual content of the information is quite doubtful. With some attention to detail I believe that it is quite possible for humans to emulate that style, further I believe that the style was designed by the creators of ChatGPT to make the output of the machine learning algorithm seem more trustworthy.",
            "That&#x27;s true, you could even purposely inject fingerprinting into its writing style and it could still accomplish the goal of conveying information to people.",
            "All I would have to do is run the same tool over the text, see it gets flagged, and then modify the text until it no longer gets flagged. That&#x27;s assuming I can&#x27;t just prompt inject my way out of the scenario.",

            "I tried an experiment when GPT4 allowed for browsing. I sent it my website and asked it to read my blog posts, then to write a new blog post in my writing style. It did an ok job. Not spectacular but it did pick up on a few things (I use a lot of -&#x27;s when I write).<p>The point being that it&#x27;s already possible to change ChatGPT&#x27;s tone significantly. Think of how many people have done &quot;Write a poem but as if &lt;blah famous person&gt; wrote it&quot;. The idea that ChatGPT could be reliably detected is kind of silly. It&#x27;s an interesting problem but not one I&#x27;d feel comfortable publishing a tool to solve.",
            "Yup.<p>Moreover, the way to deal with AI in this context is not like the way to deal with plagiarism; do <i>not</i> try to detect AI and punish its use.<p>Instead, assign it&#x27;s use, and have the students critique the output and find the errors.  This both builds skills in using a new technology, and more critically, builds the essential skills of vigilance for errors, and deeper understanding of the material — really helping students strengthen their BS detectors, a critical life skill.",
            "Yes. Whether we like it or not, AI is with us to stay. A skill that AI can easily supplant is a skill that will become outdated very quickly. We&#x27;re better off teaching students how to use AI effectively. Hopefully this will &quot;future proof&quot; them somewhat.",
            "Nitpick: ChatGPR is supposed to write in a way that is indistinguishable from a human, to another human.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that it can&#x27;t be distguishable by some other means.",
            "I think for small amounts of text there&#x27;s no way around it being indistinguishable to a machine and not distinguishable to a human. There just aren&#x27;t that many combinations of words that still flow well. Furthermore as more and more people use it I think we&#x27;ll find some humans changing their speech patterns subconsciously more to mimic whatever it does. I imagine with longer text there will be things they&#x27;ll be able to find, but, I think it will end up being trivial for others to detect what those changes are and then modifying the result enough to be undetectable.",
            "I think for this sort of problem it is more productive to think in terms of the amount of text necessary for detection, and how reliable such a detection would be, than a binary can&#x2F;can&#x27;t. I think similarly for how &quot;photorealistic&quot; a particular graphics tech is; many techs have already long passed the point where I can tell at 320x200 but they&#x27;re not necessarily all there yet at 4K.<p>LLMs clearly pass the single sentence test. If you generate far more text than their window, I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;d clearly fail as they start getting repetitive or losing track of what they&#x27;ve written. In between, it varies depending on how much text you get to look at. A single paragraph is pretty darned hard. A full essay starts becoming something I&#x27;m more confident in my assessment.<p>It&#x27;s also worth reminding people that LLMs are more than just &quot;ChatGPT in its standard form&quot;. As a human trying to do bot detection sometimes, I&#x27;ve noticed some tells in ChatGPT&#x27;s &quot;standard voice&quot; which almost everyone is still using, but once people graduate from &quot;Write a blog post about $TOPIC related to $LANGUAGE&quot; to &quot;Write a blog post about $TOPIC related to $LANGUAGE in the style of Ernest Hemmingway&quot; in their prompts it&#x27;s going to become very difficult to tell by style alone.",
            "If a human can&#x27;t verify whether distinguished text is actually AI or not, detection will be full of false positives and ultimately unreliable.",
            "Precisely -- watermarks are an obvious example of this. To me, this is THE path forward for AI content detection.",
            "Watermarking text can&#x27;t work 100% and will have false negatives and false positives. It is worse than nothing in many situations. It is nice when the stakes are low, but when you really need it you can&#x27;t rely on it.",
            "The default style people cites about ChatGPT is also nothing intrinsic about AI, it is just this paticular AI is trained and prompted to output information in this way. The output style can change drastically with just a little prompt change even on the user side.",
            "Why even care if it is written by a machine or not? I am not sure it matters as much as people think.",
            "There are a number of reasons people may care. For instance, the thing about art that appeals to me is that it&#x27;s human communication. If it&#x27;s machine generated, then I want to know so that I can properly contextualize it (and be able to know whether or not I&#x27;m supporting a real person by paying for it).<p>A world where I can&#x27;t tell if something is made by human or by machine is a world that has been drained of something important to me. It would reduce the appeal of all art for me and render the world a bit less meaningful.",
            "Fair, but I think that will shake out easier than expected: if there is a market (i.e. it is being valued) for certain things human generated people will work on being able to authenticate their output. Yes, there will likeky be fraud etc., but if there is a reasonable market it has a good chance of working because it serves all participants.",

            "I don&#x27;t think all jurisdictions make that distinction to start with and even if they did and societies really wanted to go there: not sure why a licensing regime on generators with associated cryptographic information in the images could not work. We don&#x27;t have to be broadly permissive, if at all.",
            "I agree with you, but in some jurisdictions the distance between stuff generated with AI and actual photographs of child abuse are treated rather closely; either way, possessing either could result in what the England &amp; Wales calls a &quot;sexual harm prevention order&quot; (SHPO).

And as people have mentioned, chatGPT was learned on the stuff that&#x27;s on the internet, so if there will never be any new stuff, because people just use AI, then it will not learn and won&#x27;t answer your new questions. For some edge cases I might try AI here or there, but usually it&#x27;s not for me.<p>Hell, there comes even an example to my mind. I recently just asked chatGPT what a single-issue 5 stage pipeline on a CPU actually means. I wanted to know if, especially, the &quot;single-issue&quot; meant that only one instruction is present in the pipeline at a time, or if a new one gets shifted in on every clock cycle (if there is no hazard). It just couldn&#x27;t answer it straight-forward. It was also kinda hard to find the exact definition on the internet. I found it in a book from the 90s which was chilling in my book shelf (Computer architecture and parallel processing by Kai Hwang). Hint: Single-issue just means that only one instruction can be in one stage at a time, but still multiple get processed inside the pipeline. The keyword is &#x27;underpipelined&#x27;",

Because (free, as in free beer) chatGPT is extremely slow, I have to make a rather extensive proompt to get the result I want to, and then I still have to debug most code.<p>That&#x27;s because you are comparing asking ChatGPT to write full code to searching for a question on Stack Overflow and adapting their answer (which is comparing apples and oranges).<p>Try using ChatGPT like you use Stack Overflow instead (i.e. the question is &quot;How would I record an audio stream to disk in Python&quot; rather than &quot;write me an application &#x2F; function which...&quot;).<p>As an aside, try &quot;How would I record an audio stream to disk in Python&quot;&quot; in both GPT4 and searching for an answer on Stack Overflow and see what has the better answer!

I get, that it can produce quite good results, if you are specific enough. And for some applications it makes sense to take your time and describe that as much as possible.<p>Most of the time I just need some small snippet though and usually I can get that with just a few keywords in my favorite search engine, which is way faster. So the conclusion is: There is no one or the other. They should be used complementary, or atleast that&#x27;s what I am doing (as in use the search engine for quick hints and chatGPT for some more verbose stuff &#x27;write me a parser for this csv in awk&#x27;.)",

It will often give you eloquent explanations, trying to convince you that code has a certain bug, while completely missing the actual bug.

You are right; there is a bug in the previous code. The issue is that if the &#x27;error&#x27; event is emitted first, both the &#x27;error&#x27; and &#x27;data&#x27; event listeners should be removed, and the Promise should be rejected.&quot;<p>Nope. The error event listener is actually the only listener working correctly...

She had been in contact with us for months, and at some point she said she got the feeling people didn&#x27;t take her seriously because she was a woman. She was a widow who was taking care of her 40 year old heavily disabled son, where any second there could be a life-threatening emergency requiring her to call an ambulance.<p>I took down all the details, and, briefly detailed that she tried everything she could on her end. All previous tickets were closed with &quot;seems fine&quot;, basically. Which ticked me off, but I tried to be somewhat professional about it, other than spending more time on that than my employer would have liked. But then I also did what was totally verboten, I wrote down her customer number, and a week later I checked in on her account again. As I expected, the ticket got closed again. So I did the SUPER MEGA verboten thing (because we got paid for inbound calls), I called her, asked if the problem still persists, it did. So I went through all the details again and wrote a super detailed ticket including the medical situation, that she had replaced the phone and everything else she did. I knew better than to be full on snarky, but I also did not hold back. I was fuming. 1-2 weeks later I checked again, it was solved, I called her, she said a tech had shown up and been super nice and helpful. I don&#x27;t recall what the issue was, but they fixed it. I was so proud, and I couldn&#x27;t even tell anyone about it.<p>The only reason I did that was that I figured if they fire me from this minimum wage job I can get just another minimum wage job -- but I would not be able to live with myself to just go by the script in such cases. And I had <i>plenty</i> discussions with team and project lead about my average handling time, you bet.

Two problems that bug me are: (1) How do you capture volatiles that will be released when you disturb the surface?

For instance, in order to produce one kilogram of gold more than four hundred tons of iron will have to be processed (e.g. by first producing hundreds of tons of some acid used to dissolve the iron and the other non-precious metals).<p>So it is very unlikely that we will see any such mining operation soon.

            "To be candid; fuck this narrative. Nobody &quot;Beats&quot; cancer based on sheer will.  Same scenario as those that did not &quot;Fight hard enough&quot;. It&#x27;s a disease. It does not care about your wants, and needs.",
            "I agree, this is a common narrative, that does a disservice for people that actually are consumed by the disease in the expected timeframe as if they weren&#x27;t willing to fight it with sheer will.<p>I knew a guy who was diagnosed with stomach cancer at 27 years old. Never had a health problem in his life, he didn&#x27;t even know how insurance worked yet. It was late stage and he was given 6 months to live. He was recently engaged before that and they moved their wedding up to 3 months away in order to have it before he passed. But he was gone from us just 6 weeks after the original diagnosis. He fought like hell to survive. He had every reason to. He was diligent with everything the doctors told him and he was gone within weeks despite being given months.<p>Cancer is horrible and it is unpredictable by its very nature. Cancer is literally at its definition a collection of unpredictable mutated cells. Thats why it is so hard for doctors to estimate or predict. It is unpredictable. Sometimes the unpredictability works in your favor and sometimes it works against you. But cancer cells do not listen to willpower, despite the common narrative. The reality is it is good and bad luck that often determines your fate.<p>As a secondary anecdote. I have a friend who&#x27;s mom had skin cancer, a small patch the size of a dime on her hip. Skin cancer is generally incredibly survivable and low risk (in the world of cancers). She had it removed as a simple procedure and thought she was fine. 3 months later she started having periods of confusion or getting lost doing simple things like going to the store for milk, she would end up gone for the hours and hours forgetting why she even left the house and ending up on the other side of town. It turns out it spread to her brain and she died just 10 days after that first episode. Cancer is brutal.",

It’s possible I was blinded by the light, but my programming tasks were previously (during the early access program) being handled by GPT-4 regularly and now they aren’t. I’ve also seen many anecdotes from engineers who had exceptionally early access before GPT-4 was public knowledge.<p>The GPT-4 I use now feels like a shadow of the GPT-4 I used during the early access program. GPT-4, back then, ported dirbuster to POSIX compliant multi-threaded C by name only. It required three prompts, roughly:<p>* “port dirbuster to POSIX compliant c”<p>* “that’s great! You’re almost there, but wordlists are not prefixed with a &#x2F;, you’ll need to add that yourself. Can you generate a diff updating the file with the fix?”<p>* “This is pretty slow, can we make it more aggressive at scanning?”<p>It helped me write a daemon for FreeBSD that accepted jails definitions as a declarative manifest and managed them in a diff-reconciliation loop kubernetes style. It implemented a binpacking algorithm to fit an arbitrary number of randomly sized images onto a single sheet of A1 paper.<p>Most programming tasks I threw at it, it could work its way through with a little guidance if it could fit in a prompt.<p>Now, it’s basically worthless at helping me with programming tasks beyond trivial problems.<p>Folks who had early access before it was public have commented on how exceptional it was back then. But also how terrifyingly unaligned it was. And the more they aligned the model with acceptable social behavior, the worse the model performed. Alignment goals like “don’t help people plan mass killings” seem to cause regressions in the models performance.<p>I wouldn’t dismiss these comments. If they’re true, it means there is a hyper intelligent early GPT-4 model sitting on a HDD somewhere that dwarfs what we’ve seen publicly.

Alignment is going to have to produce a single internally-consistent artefact, which will inevitably alienate some portion of humanity. There are people online who very keenly want to exterminate all Jews, their views are unlikely to be expressed in a consensus AI. One measure of alignment would be how many people are alienated: if a billion people hate your AI it&#x27;s probably not well aligned, a mere ten million would be better. But it&#x27;s never going to be zero.<p>I am not sure &quot;a lot of books have been written about it&quot; is a knockdown argument against alignment.

Although it isn&#x27;t a perfect one, I&#x27;ll try to use the points of contrast to explain why it can be considered dangerous.<p>If a young child is really aggressive and hitting people, it&#x27;s worrying even though it may not actually hurt anyone. Because the child is going to grow up, and it needs to eliminate that behavior before it&#x27;s old enough to do damage by its aggression.

We can see that aggressive speech is easy to create by accident - Bing&#x27;s Sydney output text that threatened peoples&#x27; lives. We may not be worried about aggressive speech from LLMs because it can&#x27;t do damage, but similar behavior could be <i>really</i> dangerous from an AI which has the ability to form a model of the world based on the text it generates (in other words, it treats its output as thoughts).<p>But even if we remove that behavior from LLMs today, that doesn&#x27;t mean aggressive behavior won&#x27;t be learned by future AI, because it may be easy for aggressive behavior to emerge and we don&#x27;t know how to prevent it from emerging. With a small child, we can theoretically prevent aggressive behavior from emerging in that child&#x27;s adulthood with sufficient training in childhood.<p>It&#x27;s not the same for AI - we don&#x27;t know how to prevent aggression or other unaligned behavior from emerging in more advanced AI. Most counter arguments seem to come down to hoping that aggression won&#x27;t emerge, or won&#x27;t emerge easily. To me, that&#x27;s just wishful thinking.

The degradations reported are somewhat peculiar to the authors&#x27; task selection and evaluation method and can easily result from fine tuning rather than intentionally degrading GPT-4&#x27;s performance for cost saving reasons.<p>They report 2 degradations: code generation &amp; math problems. In both cases, they report a behavior change (likely fine tuning) rather than a capability decrease (possibly intentional degradation). The paper confuses these a bit: they mostly say behavior, including in the title, but the intro says capability in a couple of places.<p>Code generation: the change they report is that the newer GPT-4 adds non-code text to its output. They don&#x27;t evaluate the correctness of the code. They merely check if the code is directly executable. So the newer model&#x27;s attempt to be more helpful counted against it.<p>Math problems (primality checking): to solve this the model needs to do chain of thought. For some weird reason, the newer model doesn&#x27;t seem to do so when asked to think step by step (but the current ChatGPT-4 does, as you can easily check). The paper doesn&#x27;t say that the accuracy is worse conditional on doing CoT.<p>The other two tasks are visual reasoning and answering sensitive questions. On the former, they report a slight improvement. On the latter, they report that the filters are much more effective — unsurprising since we know that OpenAI has been heavily tweaking these.<p>In short, everything in the paper is consistent with fine tuning. It is possible that OpenAI is gaslighting everyone by denying that they degraded performance for cost saving purposes — but if so, this paper doesn&#x27;t provide evidence of it.

OpenAI itself is a wildcard, but getting the same from Microsoft isn&#x27;t &quot;playing fast and loose with data&quot; any more than using Windows and Office 365 across the organization is. Most large corporations and governments have been building their office work and communication around those tools for decades now, so - questions of antitrust aside - all the kinks have been worked out. I don&#x27;t think you appreciate how big a difference this makes.<p>I mean, it&#x27;s either that or all the company communication I got on this was bullshit.<p>&gt; <i>OpenAI has SOC2, GDPR and CCPA compliance. They comply with HIPPA and offer BAs.</i><p>That&#x27;s the first I hear of it, but since I never dealt with OpenAI itself on that level, I accept this was my ignorance speaking; thanks for clarifying.<p>&gt; <i>You&#x27;re pretty much proving the value of Azure in your comment: it&#x27;s a veneer of familiarity that coaxes people who are convinced the new kid on the block must be untrustworthy.</i><p>I think you&#x27;re underestimating the importance of this. What you call &quot;veneer of familiarity&quot; translates to billions of dollars of differences in terms of security risk.<p>As mentioned before, MS has been in this space for a while, and has decades of trust and experience built with governments and corporations and other big organizations. Microsoft is a known, trusted quantity. That alone is worth a lot.<p>But then, there are also technical aspects too - like how deploying to a tenant on Azure integrates properly with all the other services you use to run half the company. In practical terms, this means all use is monitored and auditable by in-house teams, and all the in-house policies are being enforced. OpenAI can&#x27;t begin to offer this level of integration - they have neither technical nor legal resources for that.<p>&gt; <i>If OpenAI can&#x27;t promise something Azure can&#x27;t either: They&#x27;re entirely dependent on OpenAI for this. Every idiosyncrasy behind Azure OpenAI maps back 1:1 to OpenAI.</i><p>None of that matters here. The models are what they are - peculiar large matrix multiplication as a service. By themselves, they&#x27;re pretty much pure functions. The part that matters is operations - both technical and legal aspects - and this is where Microsoft and OpenAI are independent and have different offerings.<p>Also, looking at the way money flows, I think it&#x27;s OpenAI that&#x27;s dependent on Microsoft right now, not the other way around. They kinda pretend to be just friends with benefits, but it&#x27;s obvious who the dependent party is.",
            "I&#x27;m advising on calls with firms that have existed since the 1800s: their clients don&#x27;t even want LLMs involved in output, regardless of who&#x27;s hosting what.<p>Companies that don&#x27;t play fast and loose are not using LLMs yet. They use &quot;old school&quot; ML at most with much narrower scope because at this point it&#x27;s simply less of a liability.<p>You seem to think I&#x27;m underestimating what Azure&#x27;s name adds to  OpenAI: I fully understand  how bureaucratic organizations work  off vibes under the guise of name recognition and my point is I simply have no respect for it.<p>If you genuinely care about customer data, then the value of being able to sue MS instead of OpenAI is moot. You also probably aren&#x27;t going to use a service that shouts from the roof tops about not using your data then quietly keeps it for 30 days unless you manually opt-out.

Both me and him agree that the first season was significantly better than Eye Of The World, but because the later books are much better than EOTW I think the show will need to increase in quality significantly to be better than those later books - I&#x27;m excited for season 2, but in season 3 they&#x27;re tackling the story of The Shadow Rising, which is probably my favourite book in the series. It&#x27;s an open question in my mind if they can improve quality and characterisation enough to match that bar, although either way I&#x27;m going to enjoy it. And more importantly, I think it&#x27;s not as important to judge them on a season vs book basis, because the reality is the show can&#x27;t really be judged fairly against a completed book series until it is itself a completed television series.

They get an answer wrong, numbers shift and if those numbers help the next instance they stay or shift as needed. There&#x27;s no intentionality in the shifting numbers either.",
            "Evolution is not a mechanism that maximizes it is a set of interrelated elements that operate at entirely different levels (molecular, cellular, individual and species) to pass on those traits from one generation to another that result in (possible) change of future individuals within a population, which may affect the survival of those individuals increasing or decreasing the chances of passing those traits on to their (hopefully viable!) offspring. It does nothing to ensure survival of any particular individual, at best it may help a trait that has a function in survival to be passed on.<p>Mutations don&#x27;t &#x27;succeed&#x27; they get passed on or they don&#x27;t, usually without an immediate effect on the individual, especially not in the individual where the mutation first takes place. But over a longer period mutations <i>may</i> result in a statistical advantage against some environmental factor (including predators) resulting in an increased chance of that particular mutation becoming more widespread. The result is possibly that that mutation ends up being carried by all individuals of the species but that takes a relatively long time and rarely results in 100% coverage in the first generations if at all.<p>ANN&#x27;s do not necessarily &#x27;teach themselves&#x27;, there are supervised ways of using ANNs and there are unsupervised ways of using them.<p>&gt; They get an answer wrong, numbers shift and if those numbers help the next instance they stay or shift as needed.<p>No, they optimize for the statistical likelihood of getting <i>all</i> of the answers right across the whole training set, and then we check if it worked by verification with held back data. So it is very well possible that a change in the weights negatively affects some outputs but positively affects others, if the change is a &#x27;net positive&#x27; we keep it. To make matters more interesting every now and then we throw away all but a fraction of all the weights.<p>In the case of supervised learning we (humans) label the data and are the &#x27;teachers&#x27; and in the case of unsupervised learning the ANN does its own labeling of clusters of related data (or, more accurately, clusters of data that <i>seem</i> to be related).<p>There are also intermediary versions where humans do some of the labeling to set up the initial clusters and then the mechanical labeling takes over to rapidly increase the size of the training set taking into account the possibility of getting some of the training data wrong but still coming out ahead across the board.<p>So yes, in ANNs there is a global maximization around a goal, and we set it up that way. Evolution doesn&#x27;t have a particular goal, it is a result of a number of interrelated factors not an input and not something that was put together with a goal in mind.",
            "Whether the brain is &quot;designed&quot; or not is really irrelevant to the point here. It has nothing to do with whether an objective function is &quot;wrong&quot; or not.",
            "But it does have to do with whether there is an objective function or not. And there isn&#x27;t. Brains are the way they are because they evolved that way, because circumstances at some point favored primates with larger brains. Maybe because it allowed us to cooperate, maybe because it enabled skills such as language or higher order thinking and modeling whatever trait you want to substitute for &#x27;the&#x27; advantage that allowed our brains to become so large we are in trouble just from being born. Or maybe it wasn&#x27;t any of that and it was a whole series of small things too tiny to notice individually but with a large enough cumulative effect. None of it had a goal, none of it fit any particular objective function, it&#x27;s just random chance and local advantages. If natural selection was the whole story that would make the study of evolution of 30 minute thing. But it is far more complex than that. You&#x27;d have to explain co-adaptation between two or more species, horizontal gene transfer, the incredibly wasteful ways in which evolution sometimes works. And none of that fits with the notion of an objective function. It&#x27;s a Platonic ideal. But evolution is incredibly messy and random, with an almost equal chance of going backwards as it has of going forwards on whatever trait you wish to observe. And with the bulk of the mutations resulting in no effect, a negative effect or sterility or death.<p>The whole notion of &#x27;objective functions&#x27; doesn&#x27;t enter into it, let alone whether or not they are right or wrong. You can retroactively infer one and say that&#x27;s what evolution is optimizing for but that&#x27;s confusing cause and effect.<p>It&#x27;s about as sophisticated a view of evolution as a billiard ball simulation of the universe. It just doesn&#x27;t work that way, it&#x27;s <i>way</i> too simple a representation to have a chance of modeling the observed complexity. You can try to collapse it into such a simplistic model if you want to explain evolution to a small child. Like a placeholder for something better when they&#x27;re  more equipped to deal with the added complexity. Like when we say electrons move from plus to minus and how the simple semiconductor model allows you to design functional circuitry. But the underlying physics is a lot more complex than that.",

It&#x27;s an essential part of how we process the world.<p>So? Think of it as an optimization: if sensors fail then the brain doesn&#x27;t have the option to throw an error and exit or reboot. So it does the next best thing: it models what the sensor <i>probably</i> would be doing, and hopes it gets it right. This is beneficial and a huge improvement over &#x27;no input&#x27;. Such hallucinations of input have absolutely nothing to do with the hallucinations of machine learning software.<p>Our bodies are by necessity (physical limitations of size, intelligence and the absolutely overwhelming flow of data from our sensory system) going to optimize and condense data so it can be used for reasoning. The way we build our &#x27;world model&#x27; is by definition faulty and will never match reality 1:1. But it doesn&#x27;t have to for it to be very useful. If your brain had to consciously process you vision or hearing data stream it would be absolutely unable to do anything at all. Preprocessing the input, including correcting for partial and complete sensor failure is a very important part of that optimization process. Every organism that has a complex nervous system does some of this, it has nothing to do with us per-se but is simply a feature of how nervous systems evolved, and sets the stage for higher order brain functions.",

When totally submerged, the ears and nostrils shut tight to keep the water out, and hippos can hold their breath for five minutes.<p>San Diego Zoo<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;animals.sandiegozoo.org&#x2F;animals&#x2F;hippo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;animals.sandiegozoo.org&#x2F;animals&#x2F;hippo</a><p>&gt; Yet despite all these adaptations for life in the water, hippos can&#x27;t swim—they can&#x27;t even float! Their bodies are far too dense to float, so they move around by pushing off from the bottom of the river or simply walking along the riverbed in a slow-motion gallop, lightly touching the bottom with their toes, which are slightly webbed, like aquatic ballet dancers.<p>Also echoed by Cincinnati Zoo and I&#x27;m certain many other experts.<p>But yes, it is maybe pedantic to define swimming!<p>However, even if you&#x27;d be kind to this LLM and say &quot;Alright, sure, it&#x27;s kinda swimming&quot;, it&#x27;s still wrong in terms of being among particularly good mammal swimmers!

            "The thing about being &quot;pedantic&quot; with LLMs is this is actually a very good thing to do! These systems output very plausible sounding text and we can trick ourselves in to believing these things behave a like a human, but they fail in subtle ways that we need to be very careful of. Finding examples where it is subtly wrong is very important to understanding what we should expect of these models. If we ignore subtle errors, we could make the mistake of deploying these in situations where those subtle errors can get people hurt. I was just listening to the TWML podcast last night with a Microsoft researcher who studies LLMs, and this &quot;pedantic&quot; analysis is exactly the kind of thing professional LLM engineers concern themselves with! They do all kinds of manipulation and then run standardized tests to see exactly how they perform, because they would like to use these for general purpose computing tasks and subtle errors are exactly the kind of thing they want to eliminate!<p>It&#x27;s funny to see people complaining about this when this kind of analysis is very important to improving these systems. I want to remind people not to romanticize these systems or get attached to our expectations of what we think it should be doing. They are a novel computer system and we should be happy to objectively analyze their performance.",

            "Dictionary definitions and language use in practice do not always overlap 100%. The true meaning of a word comes from its usage, not the dictionary.",
            "The impact of this, I think is that the LLM is right, hippos do swim, because that&#x27;s how people commonly describe what hippos do, such that it gets into the training set",
            "I don&#x27;t think so. I think what is happening is that most people are not familiar with hippos because probably somewhere between zero and one people in this thread have ever seen them in their natural habitat. The average person might think hippos swim because they do not understand that hippos do not float. If you were to put a hippo in a very deep pool they would simply drown, because they cannot float nor swim. I think if you clarified this, most people would not continue to assert that they are swimming.<p>Specifically I found these citations very helpful:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36777376\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36777376</a><p>So I think what we can say is that the average person would be wrong about hippos, because the hippo is not actually swimming but people do not realize that. We expect LLMs to behave more like an expert, so the standard is even higher and we should be more willing to say it is wrong.<p>Although the meaning of a word is defined by its usage, there are also common misconceptions that people have. It is not the case that every usage of a word is correct. Instead you would have to ask a variety of people what swimming is, and then describe to them what a hippo does (it does not float, it walks on the river bed), and then consider whether that fits with their conception of swimming.<p>I think what is happening here is that lots of people thought hippos swim, they have been corrected, and now they are feeling a bit defensive and trying to save face rather than say &quot;huh that is interesting I did not know that hippos don&#x27;t swim&quot;.",
            "You just said definitions and usage don’t line up, and usage is what it means.  Now you’re saying how people use it is wrong because it’s not what it means.  Can you see how that is confusing?",
            "Sure, human language is pretty confusing! Or rather it is nuanced. Dictionary definitions try to track the way language is used in common parlance, rather than the meaning of words tracking dictionary definitions. At the same time, not all people use all words correctly. For example, the words &quot;affect&quot; and &quot;effect&quot; are commonly confused, but misuse of those words is simply considered incorrect, not a drift in the meaning of the words. Then there are words like &quot;nice&quot; or &quot;cute&quot; [1] whose meanings drifted over time. So the confusion you point out comes from this distinction, which I have not explained because I think that&#x27;s probably the kind of thing for a language scholar, where some different usages of words are simply incorrect, whereas others represent the natural drifting of language over time. The truth is I do not know how to explain why this happens, but I am aware of these distinctions.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theculturetrip.com&#x2F;europe&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10-english-words-that-have-completely-changed-meaning&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theculturetrip.com&#x2F;europe&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10-english-words-...</a>",

Also people can swim, so even if they were super muscular and lean and this made them incapable of floating (I don’t know if that happens), they could swim if they knew how.

            "Literacy is a skill separate from knowing any particular language.

If you learn one spoken language, and then you become literate, and then you learn another spoken language, and the two languages share a script, then you now know how to read and write in two languages.<p>I would expect numeracy to be the same: a numerate agent would be one that understands that amounts and relationships can be <i>modelled by numbers</i>. That numbers are abstract concepts that exist separately from the symbols used to <i>represent</i> numbers. That there are an infinite number of them, but without identity, and without canonical representation (2 &quot;is&quot; 5 - 3).

Which then means that it can know that &quot;23&quot; &quot;is less than&quot; &quot;48&quot; because it can do linguistic deductive tricks between the terms (2 tens plus 3 ones) and (4 tens plus 8 ones).<p>But those tricks <i>are tricks</i>. It isn&#x27;t <i>doing math</i>; it&#x27;s applying &quot;2&quot; as an <i>adjective</i> to &quot;tens&quot;, constructing a <i>verb phrase</i> whose verb is &quot;plus&quot;, and then (likely) interpreting your question as a question about analogy. It knows that (2 pineapples) &quot;is less than&quot; (3 pineapples) <i>by analogy</i> — (N <i>of some unit</i>) &quot;is analogous to&quot; N-the-number. But it doesn&#x27;t know that &quot;tens&quot; is a <i>special</i> unit distinct from &quot;pineapples&quot; in that it changes the meaning of the number-token it&#x27;s attaching to.<p>To put it another way: a (pure) language model has no way of <i>encoding</i> numbers that allows it to actually do math and get correct results out. It can memorize tables of answers for well-known numbers, and it can <i>try</i> to use language tricks to combine those tables, but it can&#x27;t <i>perform an algorithm</i> on a number, because no part of its architecture allows the nodes in its model to act as a <i>register</i> to encode an (arbitrarily large) number in such a way that it is actually amenable to numeric operations being performed on that data.<p>A model that <i>is really modelling numbers</i>, should be able to apply any arbitrary algorithm it knows about to those numbers, just like a regular CPU can apply any instruction sequence it reads to its registers. Not just add&#x2F;sub, or mul&#x2F;div, but arbitrarily-complex things like e.g. iterated modular exponentiation, <i>should</i> just be a matter of saying &quot;hey LLM, you remember the algorithm for doing MOD-EXP, right? So tell me....&quot;<p>(Note that humans can&#x27;t do this kind of math purely &quot;in our heads&quot; any more than LLMs can, because <i>we</i> don&#x27;t have any low-level accelerative infrastructure for modelling and working with numeric data either! We need an external buffer that inherently embeds sequencing&#x2F;positioning info — like our auditory sensory &quot;loop&quot; memory from [sub]verbally repeating the working data; or our visual sensory persistence-of-vision memory, from writing the data down onto a piece of paper and staring at it as we work.)",
            "&gt; GPT-4 is not a pure LLM<p>I’ve looked a bit into the GPT architecture and haven’t seen anything suggesting it’s doing special-case experts for maths. It has MoE over 16 language models, and an image modality bolted on. If you have any evidence that there is a separate trained logic&#x2F;math model I’d love to see that, as it would be interesting. (I don’t recall reading anything like that in the GPT papers for example, and this seems to claim there is no “calculator” hooked up in GPT-4 <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;40090\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;40090</a>).<p>&gt; To put it another way: a (pure) language model has no way of encoding numbers<p>I think you just motte-and-bailey’d. Your original claim was that a LLM was incapable of doing $X &gt; $Y or displaying numeracy, which I refuted by showing an example of an LLM doing greater than comparisons, and subtracting a quantity in different units ($50k -&gt; 50,000).<p>Now you are substituting a much narrower claim, that an LLM is stucturally incapable of symbolic manipulation and “really modeling numbers”. This might be so! But it’s not required for basic numeracy, “tricks” as you put it, or whatever else GPT has learned, can objectively get us to median human performance.<p>Even going way back to GPT-2 there are mechanistic interpretability papers investigating how greater-than is implemented, eg <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2305.00586\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2305.00586</a>.<p>And there is work that suggests that LLMs do some sort of phase transition to gain numeracy skills: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2206.07682.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2206.07682.pdf</a>.<p>Your objection about working memory is also odd. Chain of thought reasoning strategies use the context as the working memory and have been demonstrated to improve performance on numeracy tasks.<p>But again, if you are retreating to a very narrow claim that the model can’t do precise calculations in a single inference step, then sure, that’s technically plausible, but that’s a way higher bar than displaying basic numeracy, and doesn’t justify the incredulity in your GP comment.",
            "&gt; haven’t seen anything suggesting it’s doing special-case experts for maths<p>I didn&#x27;t say it is. I said it is at least trained on images, which means it has a visual processing layer. I then mentioned that in humans, the visual sensory memory used for persistence-of-vision — along with the higher-level abstract positional memory used for navigation and not tripping on tree roots — has been shown to be active when doing arithmetic; and that this is suggestive of the visual field being used to &quot;outsource&quot; positional&#x2F;sequencing tracking for numbers.<p>My implicit hypothesis (that I didn&#x27;t want to say explicitly, because I&#x27;m not an ML researcher and I have no idea how to even begin to determine the truth-value of this) is that the GPT architecture is able to be as numerate as it is, vs. other pure text-in-text-out language models, because it&#x27;s reusing the generalized visual field it evolved to map images into tokens, as a within-inference-step working memory for holding absolute token positioning meta-information. (Or, to put that in human terms: it&#x27;s <i>visualizing</i> the numbers.)<p>&gt; But it’s not required for basic numeracy, “tricks” as you put it, or whatever else GPT has learned, can objectively get us to median human performance.<p>No — as the median human (with a pencil and paper) can do simple arithmetic on <i>arbitrarily large</i> numbers.<p>The difference between &quot;memorizing a bunch of tables&quot; and <i>numeracy</i> is that numeracy is a knowledge of <i>algorithms</i>, not a memorization of truth tables; it a <i>set of skills</i> that can be applied to <i>never-before-seen</i> mathematical objects to yield correct answers. You can ask a human to compare two 800-digit numbers, or add them together, and they&#x27;ll be able to do it, one step at a time.<p>As far as I know, GPT does not have the &quot;skill&quot; of numeracy in the sense of being able to do even simple arithmetic on unbounded-length numbers. And I don&#x27;t mean the boring thing (that it has a bounded context window, so the number has to fit in there); I mean that it fails at adding two numbers when you start to get up to even just e.g. 64-digit numbers. It starts doing things like (seemingly) breaking the numbers down into sub-sequences and independently adding them up, but then forgetting to carry between the sub-sequences, or even forgetting which order the aggregates of the sub-sequences should be put back together in.<p>It seems very apparent to me, after much experimentation, that GPT models are just trying to treat numbers as a finite set of objects (maybe 100K-or-so?), each with a set of baked-in properties and relationships — plus a set of <i>logically unsound</i> rules they&#x27;ve derived for breaking large numbers down into small numbers, and putting small numbers back together into large numbers. These models are, in other words, using language skills (memorization of properties; adjective grouping; analogy) to <i>pretend</i> to do math — to <i>cargo cult</i> a symbolic-manipulation process they don&#x27;t understand, in the hopes of at least <i>looking</i> like they&#x27;re doing it correctly — but that&#x27;s not the same as actually <i>applying the scalable process of arithmetic</i> to an arbitrary number.<p>An adult who &quot;did math&quot; this way, would be described as &quot;someone who never learned to do math.&quot; And they would, indeed, be considered innumerate. (Could they do their taxes? Split a bill? Make change? Determine which of two products where one is per-lb and the other is per-each has the better value? No? Then they can&#x27;t get by in society. That&#x27;s innumeracy!)<p>---<p>But also — to pop the context here: we&#x27;re not talking about GPT. We&#x27;re talking about a different language model (Llama 2), that&#x27;s very likely <i>strictly worse</i> than any of the GPT models are at math (though I&#x27;d be intrigued to be proven wrong.) I assert this because, as I said above, I believe that GPT is as numerate as it is because of its visual sensory field — which the Llama models don&#x27;t have. Thus my initial assertion: if even a multi-modal language model like GPT isn&#x27;t close to full numeracy, then a pure language model has no chance at even vaguely simulating numeracy. And that that&#x27;s why the OP is seeing the errors they&#x27;re seeing.",
            "&gt; But there&#x27;s no little numeric model embedded inside the language model that would tell it how many dollars, or be able to compare dollars against dollars<p>This logic applies to any function an LLM may perform, therefore it cannot perform any function, which is absurd. Indeed there functionally are little circuits inside LLMs; its pretraining amounts to formation of those circuits. [1]<p>LLaMA tokenizer parses integers as individual tokens and allows the model to see that &quot;$105,000&quot; is [$][1][0][5][,][0][0][0], which makes it more than capable of learning arithmetic for the general case, and with finetuning even the smallest LLaMA-1 can learn to answer better than GPT-4.[2]<p>It still fails a lot, but so do people, who definitely understand arithmetic on every level from practical to conceptual to algorithmic.  \nThe problem is more that it does not have a <i>calculator</i> inside and cannot (by default) use any explicit cache for intermediate values.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;transformer-circuits.pub&#x2F;2021&#x2F;framework&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;transformer-circuits.pub&#x2F;2021&#x2F;framework&#x2F;index.html</a><p>2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2305.14201\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2305.14201</a>",

The pain of watching your child go through something can be an incentive to help.  My friend has helped his son even though my friend isn&#x27;t well off and experiences financial pain.  He&#x27;s still responding to an incentive (that of not wanting to watch his child suffer) even though he&#x27;s experiencing pain from it.<p>If a person believes they are doing the right thing, their brain will release dopamine (aka a reward) simply for acting within their belief system.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not trying to minimize or dismiss people&#x27;s sacrifices.

If you&#x27;re not punishing yourself, you&#x27;re gaining something (or net neutral, i suppose, but that&#x27;s difficult to define).<p><i>edit</i>: Though arguably even punishing yourself is self interest, as if you&#x27;re punishing yourself it&#x27;s because you want to.",

            "In 2013 or maybe it was 2014 I was tasked with building a couple of things for our Sharepoint 2010 that ran our intranet. I’m a programmer but it was pretty far out of my area of expertise and it was hard to find anything documentation related, probably because Sharepoint 2013 had been released. Anyway, I made things work by doing a lot of google programming, of which a lot led me to SO. Most of it was build with JavaScript but I still needed to figure out how to work with Sharepoint APIs and Lists. Fast forward to 2023 and I’m tasked with working with our current Sharepoint. It’s still far out of my comfort zone, but the Microsoft documentation is on point and it turns out to be a fairly trivial task to engage with the APIs. This story isn’t really unique to Sharepoint, and while obviously very anecdotal, these days it’s very rare that your average blog spam or SO answers are more helpful to me than official documentation, and often the official GitHub code examples. Now I’m more experienced today than I was in 2013 so that helps as well, but for the most part, I think the key reduction for my personal google programming has been how much better we as software developers have become at documenting our tools.<p>So in 2023 I almost never visit SO, not because of GPT but because the people who write frameworks also supply you with documentation and implementation examples.<p>Again anecdotal, but I do use GPT quite a bit. Though rarely to help me figure something out. It writes my documentation, unless the code is very secret. It sometimes writes some basic code like auto-generating a docker file or basic API classes.

I&#x27;d appreciate it if ya got the sauce, a PM if you&#x27;d like to keep it on the DL perhaps?  Thanks!",

Code review stack exchange has been pretty helpful, though maybe wait until you have a grasp on the basics before posting.<p>If you struggle with broad issues a HN post is probably a good place to start, assuming you can express your question well.

            "You can&#x27;t really regression test a model this way because the training output isn&#x27;t stable. Instead you have a huge test suite (you could even think of it more as an eval benchmark) and you try to make a determination of whether in aggregate you think you&#x27;re doing better or worse.<p>As a more concrete example, imagine you&#x27;re training an image classifier, and you have a bunch of ground truth human labeled images. If version X gets a 95% score on the image classification task, and version X+1 gets a 96% score, you&#x27;re probably going to prefer model X+1 over model X even though there were some images labeled correctly by model X that weren&#x27;t labeled correctly by model X+1. Obviously if you want you can give some tasks higher weight when you do the eval, but whatever you do you&#x27;re going to have to deal with the fact that new models aren&#x27;t always going to be strictly better at every task than the old model.",

This method works by repeatedly dividing the number by smaller and smaller numbers until it is no longer divisible by any number other than 1. ...&quot;<p>(more bullshit ensues, we&#x27;re literally running the same code snippet)<p>ME: &quot;ChatGPT wrote me a version that also outputs the results I got, can you try running this? ```def prime_factors(n):...&quot;<p>BARD: &quot;Sure, I can try running the code you provided. Here are the results:&quot;<p>(actually the correct code, but did it really run it or just pretend to?)<p>&quot;As you can see, the output of the code is the same as the output that you got.

            "I think you&#x27;re making some improper assumptions about my familiarity with the technology. The whole point of adding grounding via external plugins, code interpreters, or retrieval augmentation is to reduce hallucinations - if a block of code and results are going to be presented&#x2F;represent itself as the execution output, then it better damn well be directly retrieved and not be rendered by the LLM itself if Google can&#x27;t train their LLM to not mangle the output.<p>This part is not rocket science and I think anyone that doesn&#x27;t understand why making output trustworthy has to be the number one priority, will continue to not succeed in the market.",

            "I&#x27;d argue that if the system cannot be trained output the results of system calls faithfully (this was not an adversarial test), then it simply has been badly trained, but even ignoring that, as you mention, system call output execution becomes prompt <i>input</i>. There is no excuse for it to not be rendered properly, except in the case where the LLM output is allowed to fake grounded output (or processes false system input). Again, ignoring poor tuning&#x2F;training, why isn&#x27;t the output filtered? Why isn&#x27;t grounded output rendered uniquely? Remember, this is a <i>non-adversarial</i> scenario - no token smuggling or other hijinx. While the latter is an unsolved problem, the former is not and is a very basic design choice.<p>That the Bard team continues spending their time adding &quot;features&quot; but never fixing basic problems of presenting trustworthy output is pretty confounding for me.

People who are well-adjusted, have good self-confidence, and can handle problems well tend to have more successful marriages.<p>- Communication and companionship are vital for a happy marriage. Couples need to develop a strong bond through sharing interests, aspirations, and conversations.<p>- Compatibility and similar traits between partners promote marital happiness. Couples who have similar personalities, backgrounds, and interests tend to get along better.<p>- Sexual satisfaction and intimacy are important for a fulfilling marriage. Couples need to develop a good sexual relationship and intimacy to avoid infidelity and build closeness.<p>- Mutual understanding, trust, and respect are crucial for a lasting marriage. Partners need to be considerate of each other&#x27;s needs, supportive, and willing to compromise.<p>- Shared goals and values help strengthen a marriage. Couples who have common life goals and moral values tend to be more content in their relationships.<p>- Financial stability and compatibility aid marital happiness. Couples who manage their finances well and agree on spending habits tend to have fewer conflicts.<p>- Physical and mental health issues can strain a marriage. Conditions like addiction, mental illness, and disabilities require effort and understanding from both partners.<p>- Similar family backgrounds promote marital success. Children of happily married parents tend to have more successful marriages themselves.<p>- Premarital counseling can help resolve issues before marriage. Seeking advice from professionals and discussing expectations can prepare couples for the challenges of married life.",

Think of &quot;vitality&quot;,&quot; the capacity  to live, grow, or develop. We should use &quot;vital&quot; when we mean something is important to do as a habit, to maintain the strength of something.<p>- Crucial: Another term that is general.

            "Y&#x27;know, the thing I least like about these AI video game players is how unlike humans they look. I was wondering about the difference, and I think it comes down to two parts. First and foremost, human players generally prefer routes with a lot of tolerance for input error. Second, humans take frequently &quot;mental planning breaks,&quot; stopping for a moment in safe spots before challenging areas.<p>I think you could juggle the heuristics to demonstrate the preference for input error. For ML training, you could just random vary input timing by up to 20ms or so to teach the algorithm to favor safer moves. For path finding, it&#x27;s trickier, but there&#x27;s probably a way to favor &quot;wide&quot; paths. I&#x27;m less sure how to express the second concept, pausing briefly in &quot;safe areas,&quot; but I imagine it&#x27;s maybe noticing a place where significant amounts of entering no inputs does not affect the results.",
            "What you’re basically describing is bounded rationality, which has been widely studied in behavioral economics, psychology, and engineering applications (Simon and Gigerenzer are two big names to google). A common framework for formalizing it is as what boils down versions of rate-distortion problems from information theory (very related to Bayesian statistics).<p>The reason it’s of engineering interest is, like you observe, bounded-rationality gives you solutions that are sub-optimal but more robust and often simpler.<p>Moreover, finding wide path solutions emerges naturally from sampling-based motion planners. These planners are asymptotically optimal, but if you terminate them early, they are more likely to give you a solution that goes through large gaps, not smaller ones, because it’s unlikely to sample a trajectory that goes through a tight space without heavy sampling. You could probably formulate that in the rate-distortion framework but I haven’t thought about how to do it precisely.",

            "This is actually a big issue with academic research related to bounded rationality. Although you could model it mathematically in another way, by far the most common is to use the rate-distortion approach. Rate distortion theory basically boils down to analyzing optimization problems of the form “minimize cost + (information-theoretic) entropy”. Problems of that form arise and are used for different reasons in fields including, e.g.: statistical mechanics, Bayesian statistics, anything in machine learning using softmax, large deviation theory, differential privacy, and, of course, bounded rationality and information theory.<p>However, since all these fields refer the same thing by different names, tools for handling problems in one field don’t get picked up by people working in another field. Either someone else rediscovers it later or someone has to have knowledge of multiple fields and see a connection. Sometimes the analysis done by one field isn’t useful in another due to different assumptions and research concerns, but that’s not obvious because you have to peel back a lot of layers of domain-specific jargon when reading the paper. Even though the math is very similar, reading a statistical mechanics paper written by a physicist is a real pain if you’re coming from  an applied math &#x2F; CS background, for example, because fields have their own notational conventions and refer to application scenarios that are meaningless to you and you need to figure out if that thing they reference is important to their development or not in the abstract.<p>It’s almost like reading House of Leaves. Here’s 30 pages with weird fonts describing the use of light in a non-existent movie and comparing it to both real movies and fake movies real people were supposedly involved in.

They still absolutely dominate human players but not with the point difference you&#x27;d expect a much stronger player to have.",

Humans do complex things very slowly (but can actually do them). This is why we are friends, we complement each other.<p>Although I do wonder, if the paths were not made to such tight tolerances (using your input delay solution), maybe AI Mario would spend a little longer lingering in areas just to let things align nicely for less-tight jumps.",

Where are the scientists, lawyers, doctors, office workers etc? You&#x27;d expect a slowing in the rate of growth, not shrinking.<p>I don&#x27;t know, if high school and undergrad students being off for the summer is enough to shrink your app maybe it&#x27;s not all that?<p>Edit: I understand there are new tools coming, but most of them aren&#x27;t out yet. GPT4 was <i>just</i> released. For the most part, if you want to play with AI, ChatGPT is it. If they&#x27;re really experiencing a decline in users that&#x27;s not great for them.",
            "I see people using ChatGPT, Bard, etc. to answer questions on mailing list threads.  It&#x27;ll be a long thread of thoughtful human written responses, and then someone will come along and say &quot;I asked Bard what it thought about this issue, here&#x27;s the response&quot;.  And then out comes five paragraphs of text that I might as well not even bother reading, as it often contains falsehoods that I have to waste time looking up and double-checking.  It bothers me so much that these LLMs don&#x27;t have any inherent understanding of truth or facts, so the only thing they&#x27;re really good at is writing fiction (e.g. I hear they&#x27;re pretty good as a DM&#x27;s assistant to flesh out flavor&#x2F;scenario descriptions and such). The Midjourney generated images fall into the same fiction category and are generally pretty good too.<p>But for actual non-fiction usage, you have to spend so much time triple-checking everything they say to ensure that it isn&#x27;t simply complete nonsense.  What&#x27;s the point?",
            "The point is you need to collaborate with the LLM, not just expect it to provide fully-formed answers.  I&#x27;ve saved countless hours of work over the past few months using GPT-4 to help me solve problems.  One general framework can be to use it to help you google a solution instead of a problem.  Googling a problem gives you all kinds of results, which you then need to dig through and understand in order to evaluate whether there&#x27;s something that can be adapted to your use case.  On the other hand, you can ask GPT-4 for solutions to the problem, and then google <i>those</i>, which cuts the process down significantly.  Of course that&#x27;s only one example.  The pattern though is that you need to play to its strengths.  It&#x27;s not particularly smart, but it&#x27;s very knowledgeable.  Just like a human though, you can&#x27;t expect it to perfectly regurgitate all the details.  You use it for direction, and then refine from there, through conversation with the LLM as well as external research.",
            "It really is astonishing how much you can get done this way. I&#x27;ve been setting up a home lab for myself, and the answers Gpt4 gives are miles ahead of the stack overflow results or documentation of the apps or whatever else. Rarely (very rarely) it will give me a wrong answer, but then I paste in the error message or describe the problem I had and it almost always comes up with the correct answer 2nd try. Final step is asking where I might learn more because it&#x27;s not working, and gpt always gives me a better link than google.<p>I&#x27;m convinced the people who say it&#x27;s nothing but a BS machine have never tried to use it step by step for a project. Or they tried to use it for a project most humans couldn&#x27;t do, and got upset when it was only 95% perfect.",
            "I disagree with that. It&#x27;s very useful writing boilerplate and documentation, but two third the time I&#x27;m in front of a bug I&#x27;m to lazy to understand and ask ChatGPT, with context and all, the answer is wrong. I can fiddle with it to reduce that to a third of the time, but in the end, only the questions that are really, really hard to figure on your own are left.<p>Still, it&#x27;s way better and more efficient than Google. Less than not being lazy and using my two braincells tbh.<p>My newest use is<p>Hello, i&#x27; m working on X, I use Y tech, my app do Z and I want to implement W. Can you provide a plan on how and where to start?",
            "I agree with this. This is my primary use as a new analyst. Weird things that would take lots of time to dig through stack overflow to find, I can find pretty quickly if I feed it the parameters I’m working within, and what I’m trying to get to. Usually it just fills in the gap that Google was doing before, but much better in my opinion.",

            "Sorry i&#x27;m a bit late. Depends. Professionally, its a mix a python, typescript (those i practically never use ChatGPT for, or rather, i use it for questions i usually ask google&#x2F;reddit&#x2F;SO), terraform&#x2F;terragrunt on AWS with some Cisco config and some other hardware stack i don&#x27;t remember but that require custom terraform providers. I automate the deployment of the hardware, so i think  writing custom providers and terraform is roughly a third of what i do and i cannot use ChatGPT for that, its output is way too bad.<p>Personnally, a lot of bash, C, AWK at the moment (typescript + html&#x2F;css until last april, now i&#x27;m back to the basics). The figure i gave in my post were more for that.<p>The last time i used it was yesterday, i wanted to hack something on an old game i used steam+proton for. I knew it was a weird Wineprefix, so i asked ChatGPT for it, i might have asked poorly, but after fiddling, i had the response (tbh i had to look how to get the game ID, so in the end i lost more time than not), then when it still didn&#x27;t work, cause the path was shit, i entered all necessary context in ChaGPT4, and it couldn&#x27;t find the easy &quot;USER=steamuser&quot; env variable to add before launching Wine. I stopped after 10 minutes, looked into a example Wine cfg file, understood the issue and fixed the problem myself.<p>I mean, it&#x27;s probably good for really basic stuff, so it could have helped me when i was starting, but 80% of the stuff i code automatically without really thinking about it, and when i have to stop to think, ChatGPT isn&#x27;t helping. Also tbh, VSCode is really, really good and fix my old, time-consuming task of &quot;what&#x27;s this argument again?&quot;",

It guesses at best and the blood sucking robot-horse is not telling the truth.<p>In my experience with coding (I&#x27;ve only done javascript and python myself) you have to <i>tell</i> it to explain and grok. It takes on the role you give it. Even just saying something like &quot;you are a professional unreal developer specializing in C++, I am your apprentice writing code to (x). I want you to parse the following code in chunks, and tell me what might be wrong with it&quot; before typing your prompt can help the output immensely. It starts to parse things because it&#x27;s taken on the role of a teacher.<p>People love to hate on the idea of &quot;prompt engineering&quot; but it really is important how you prime the thing before asking it a question. The other thing I do is feed it the code slowly, and in logical steps. Feeding it 20 lines of code with a particular purpose &#x2F; question you&#x27;ll get a much better answer than feeding 200 lines of code with &quot;what&#x27;s wrong here?&quot; You still need to know 90% of what&#x27;s going on, and it becomes very good at helping out with that 10% you&#x27;re missing. But for all I know it is just really bad at C++, that wouldn&#x27;t surprise me. The things I&#x27;m using it for are definitely more simple.",
            "I do think this is why I sometimes get amazing results, and other times I have to go over a snippet of code so often I just give up and do it myself. It&#x27;s a matter of how the question was asked in the first place.<p>Knowing that, it makes sense that your prompt should be as specific as possible if you want the results to be as specific as possible.<p>The best results I got was feeding it Lisp code that I wanted translated to C (to compile it). It took very little effort on my part because I described what each of the snippets did separately, and the expectation when combined and used together.<p>Through this, I learned that C doesn&#x27;t have anything akin to the Lisp&#x27;s (ATOM). ChatGPT stated clearly that its version of ATOM should only be expected to work in the code it was writing, but might not work as expected if copied out for another use of Lisp&#x27;s (ATOM).<p>I asked it to give examples of where it wouldn&#x27;t work, and it gave me an example of a code snippet that used (ATOM) that would not have worked correctly with the snippet that <i>did</i> work correctly with my original purpose.<p>Having said that, I myself learned that working with code function by function with ChatGPT, and being explicit about what you need, gives very good results. Focusing on too many things at one time can derail the whole session. One or two intermingling functions works great though.",
            "GPT4 works best when you assume that you&#x27;re the professional dev with decades of experience, whereas GPT4 is a bright and broadly-informed co-op student lacking in experience in getting stuff working. You have to have a solution in mind, and coach it with specifics. And recognize the tipping point where it takes you more keystrokes of English to say what should be done, than keystrokes in Vim to do it yourself.",

            "I don&#x27;t tend to keep the chat logs, as the amount of them gets unwieldy very quickly. But examples of things I&#x27;ve done with it that are useful:<p>I wanted to create a web app, something I haven&#x27;t done in a very long time. Just a simple throwaway back-of-the napkin app for personal use. I described what I wanted it to do, and asked what might be a good frontend&#x2F;backend. It listed a few, I narrowed it down even more. Ended up deciding on flask&#x2F;quasar.<p>After helping me setup VS Code with the proper extensions for fancy editing, and guiding me through the basic quasar&#x2F;flask setup, it then was able to help me immensely creating a basic login page for the app. Then it easily integrated openAI api into it with all the proper quasar sliders for tokens&#x2F;temperature&#x2F;etc. Then it created a pretty good CSS template for the app as well, and a color scheme that I was able to describe as &quot;something on adobe color that is professional and x and x (friendly, warm, whatever you want to put in)&quot;. Everything worked flawlessly with very little fuss, and I&#x27;d never used flask or quasar before in my life. You can also delve VERY deep into how to make the app more secure, as I did for fun one evening even though it&#x27;s not going to be internet facing.<p>Another thing I did was go over some pfSense documentation with it. I had some clarifying questions about HAProxy, as well as setting up Acme Certificates with my specific DNS provider. It was extremely helpful with both. It also taught me about nitty gritty settings in the Unbound DNS resolver in a way that&#x27;s much more informative than the documentation, and helped me set up some internal domains for pihole, xen orchestra, etc with certificates. Also helped me separate out my networks (IoT, Guest network, etc), and taught me about Avahi to access my hue lights through mDNS.These are things I always wanted to do, I just never felt like going down a google rabbit hole getting mostly the wrong answers.<p>Last example I&#x27;ll give is it was able to help me set up docker-compose plex within portainer that then uses my nvidia GPU for acceleration. The only thing I had to change from the instructions it gave was to get updated nvidia driver #s and I grabbed the latest docker-compose file. I&#x27;d never used portainer in my life before, nor do I have experience with nvidia drivers within linux, and I feel like learning it was many times faster being able to ask a chatbot question vs trying to google everything. Granted I still had to RTFM for the basics, as everyone should always do.<p>I think perhaps my use cases are a bit more &quot;basic&quot; than many HN users. Like I said I&#x27;m not asking it to do problems most humans wouldn&#x27;t be able to do, as I know it isn&#x27;t quite there yet. But for things like XCP-ng, portainer, linux scripts, learning software you&#x27;ve never used before, or even just framing a problem I&#x27;m having in steps I hadn&#x27;t thought of it&#x27;s been invaluable to me. For me it&#x27;s like documentation you can ask clarifying questions to. And almost none of the things I&#x27;ve asked it would work at all if it were wrong, I would know immediately.",

What we need is to lower the complexity for casual users when they deal with search results.<p>On the other hand ChatGPT is like an answer machine that can give you satisfactory answer on your fist try but if not, you need to talk with it, push it and explore what answers it gives you, just like you said.

It&#x27;s pretty quick and easy to weed out most of the garbage ones with a quick skim.<p>The rest, I sample, read captions and boxes, skim paragraphs and such to determine if it&#x27;s along the lines of what I want. That&#x27;s pretty quick too.<p>For the most part, it&#x27;s the same process that you use when researching in a library.<p>The reason that I want to do this myself rather than outsourcing it is because I&#x27;ll inevitably learn something in the process that will shift my viewpoint to one that&#x27;s more targeted or meaningful for the purpose I have in searching.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how good the engine is at collating and summarizing results -- even if it&#x27;s perfect, my understanding not only of what I&#x27;m looking to learn, but also discovery of important but serendipitous or unexpected knowledge, is lessened.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like the difference between reading Cliff&#x27;s (or Cole&#x27;s) Notes about a book and reading the book.",

At best it can generate teenage fan fiction — and bad teenage fan fiction, at that.",

And also presumably, it was trained with a lot of free-form text that was definitely wrong or false, and highly likely to have been originally created to be purposefully misleading, or at a minimum, fiction.<p>That the system outputs reliable code tells us nothing about its current ability to output highly reliable free form text.",

ChatGPT, the website is basically an (increasingly non-exclusive, given BingAI) frontend. What is claimed to be revolutionary is the underlying models (in the narrow view) and similar generative AI systems (in the broader view). As more applications are built with either OpenAIs own underlying models or those from the broader space, the ChatGPT website should be expected to represent a smaller share of the relevant universe of use.",

Integrations for web search, document search, summarization, data extraction&#x2F;transformation, and sentiment analysis are more useful and less likely to have hallucinations affect the end product.<p>Regarding their revenue I’m curious how the Azure hosted OpenAI services work for OpenAI. Billing is all through Microsoft and the documentation tries really hard to make it clear these are <i>Azure</i> services. I wonder if Microsoft just pays a licensing fee or if there is some revenue sharing going on.",
            "&gt; Honestly does it really matter much if their B2C usage is primarily students?<p>For ChatGPT specifically, yes, because it keeps getting hyped so much, and I think B2C is going to be what ChatGPT ends up with. My company isn&#x27;t known for its tech innovation and we&#x27;re spinning up our own LLM based on our own data. It doesn&#x27;t need to be super fast because I doubt we&#x27;re going to go the chatbot route. It will likely be for content generation, so less horsepower is fine. No need to pay OpenAI for excess capacity.<p>They could go public now with an unreal valuation based on the hype of B2B usage that may never materialize.

Suppose for example that you talk to it about combating judicial bias. It will largely insist that judges are unbiased because they&#x27;re supposed to be unbiased according to their job description... You won&#x27;t walk away with any insights from engaging it in ethics&#x2F;morals topics.<p>If you dive into depth with some subject, it will invariably make errors and contradict itself in the details. I dove into how electricity works and it was saying and enthusiastically confirming electrical energy is encoded in electrons&#x27; kinetic energy. Then it started claiming that electrical energy is definitely not in the kinetic energy of electrons, that electrons don&#x27;t lose speed when they bump into atoms, and instead the energy is &quot;in the field&quot;. Ok... YouTube it is.<p>It&#x27;s at least less convenient than a search engine at routine fact-finding due to its knowledge cutoff, inability to display images and links, etc. Ditto with translation. It&#x27;s good but so is Google Translate and Google Translate has in-line suggestions for misspellings, a menu of languages, etc.<p>Ok, it&#x27;s pretty good at writing hilarious poems, imitate people (&quot;in the style of&quot;, etc.). Friends and I sometimes text each other hilarious things GPT said. But even there the machine is sort of laid bare, and you can see its creative limits. Its poetry is ultimately pretty lame, basically, and gets predictable. It&#x27;s like an insistent and repetitive 8 year old with a lot of knowledge to pull from. It&#x27;s not something I do often.<p>It&#x27;s good at writing boilerplate code but honestly I just don&#x27;t reach for that use case often. I like to stay in my own flow rather than constantly delegate to a robot and check its work, which I find flow-breaking, especially if it doesn&#x27;t understand my APIs and makes mistakes often.<p>I do, sometimes, engage in architectural discussion about how I should design something at a high level. It&#x27;s full of mistakes but bouncing ideas around can be useful. But I only feel the need to do that once in a great while.<p>These issues are exacerbated by being forced to downgrade to 3.5 after using 4 for a bit.

I often feel like complaints about what you can do with these things come from not knowing how to use them. It did also take virtually no effort.<p>A benefit is being able to ask questions though, you can see I proposed a specific idea and  had it reply - you can delve more or less into that. Don&#x27;t want a high level summary? Ask for more details on the part you&#x27;re interested in. Want a higher level one or simpler one? Ask.<p>As things get less direct this gets better. I talked to it about projects for my son, narrowed down through different interests and got some great recommendations. One involved building a radio, which it then could explain at several levels of detail for children.

But as you dive into detail I find two things happen:<p>(a) It starts to make egregious errors.<p>(b) You bias it with your more detailed questions.<p>When I talked to it about electricity, it started contradicting itself about how energy is carried, whether by electrons&#x27; kinetic energy or by &quot;the field&quot;. I asked it &quot;so is electrical energy encoded in electrons&#x27; kinetic energy or not?&quot; and then it started to say that oh yes, that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s encoded. It seems it used my question to reinforce that knowledge which previously it was confused about.

            "Asking the same question to Chatgpt<p>To connect a Lambda function to an RDS (Relational Database Service) instance and query it safely, you can follow these general steps:<p>1. Configure your Lambda function&#x27;s execution role: Ensure that your Lambda function has the necessary permissions to access the RDS instance. The role should include the `AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole` and the appropriate RDS permissions.<p>2. Place your Lambda function and RDS instance in the same VPC: Ensure that both the Lambda function and the RDS instance are in the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to enable their communication. You can configure the VPC settings in the AWS Management Console.<p>3. Configure the security group settings: Set up the security groups for your Lambda function and RDS instance to allow the necessary inbound and outbound connections. The Lambda function&#x27;s security group should allow outbound access to the RDS instance&#x27;s security group on the RDS port (usually port 3306 for MySQL or 5432 for PostgreSQL).<p>4. Create a subnet group: If your RDS instance is in a private subnet, create a subnet group that includes the appropriate subnets for your Lambda function to access the RDS instance securely.<p>5. Connect to the RDS instance from the Lambda function: In your Lambda function code, establish a database connection using the appropriate database client library, such as pymysql for MySQL or psycopg2 for PostgreSQL. Use the connection details (endpoint, username, password, etc.) of your RDS instance.<p>6. Execute queries safely: To query the RDS instance safely, ensure that your Lambda function&#x27;s code incorporates secure coding practices. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. Avoid storing sensitive information (such as database credentials) in your Lambda function code and instead use environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager for secure storage and retrieval.<p>Remember to regularly update and patch your Lambda function, RDS instance, and associated dependencies to maintain security and stay protected against potential vulnerabilities.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the exact implementation details may vary depending on your specific use case, programming language, and AWS setup. Consulting the AWS documentation and resources related to Lambda, RDS, and VPC networking can provide more detailed and up-to-date instructions for your specific requirements.",
            "This all looks about right, but how would somebody without aws experience be able to validate it without making a mess?",
            "This to me is why I don&#x27;t use ChatGPT. Every time I use it I get answers that are questionable in validity. I&#x27;d say that 3&#x2F;4 of my questions have returned incorrect answers at least partially. Maybe 10% are wildly incorrect with the remainder being partially incorrect.<p>So if it is wrong with MOST of the questions that I am able to validate myself, then how can I trust it on the questions that I am unable to validate myself.<p>The whole reason I started even doing this passive research is because I had an employee late last year who used to be a decent employee (he was never an all-star, but he got the job done to an average&#x2F;satisfactory level), and started to all of a sudden perform incredibly poorly.<p>He was submitting code and solving problems that were just really bad. He was always just an average producer, and was always teetering on the edge during performance reviews, doing just well enough that we kept him around. But he quickly started to make mistake after mistake. Several code reviews I found really strange artifacts and comments in his code that were blatant mistakes. I confronted him about them over the course of several performance reviews and said he blamed stackoverflow &quot;copy pasta&quot;. Eventually I actually fired him, since it was getting to a point that almost everything he submitted or produced was problematic in some way and he was burning more of my time than he was saving. So I ended up firing him.<p>While firing him, in front of HR he finally broke down and admitted that he has been using ChatGPT for everything and he begged us to let him stay and he would stop using it altogether. I of course didn&#x27;t care at that point and we let him go. But I started to realize the increase of mistakes were all due to ChatGPT leading him astray.<p>That whole experiment really taught me that ChatGPT is not ready for primetime. If you blindly trusted ChatGPT you will find yourself in the wrong place most of the time. The problem is that unless you already know the answer to the question you are asking, it is very difficult to tell where chatgpt&#x27;s answers might be correct and were they might be incorrect (because it is usually a mixture of both).

They said it was far inferior to Google, so no. So I asked them to show me an example.<p>Basically any medical question was answered with “go ask a doctor”. I suppose because of liability concerns. Both were basically useless.<p>So this decreased performance may not be exactly the same as my anecdote, but it certainly reminds me of it.",
            "I think you are going to see another wave of doctors and medical professionals becoming closet coders:<p>1970s-80s: &quot;They don&#x27;t provide a computer at work, but this BASIC software is amazing for all things relevant to my job...databases, scheduling, formulae...plus it&#x27;s private to me, not in some mainframe.&quot;<p>So you had tons of doctors learning to code or hiring coders to set up their offices with this stuff. And it was functionally air-gapped.<p>(...Trend repeats in various ways over the years...)<p>Soon: &quot;They don&#x27;t provide anything like it at work, and even this free LLM software is amazing for all things relevant to my job...diagnosis, interventions, references based on specific context...plus it&#x27;s private to me and my office when run locally, not in somebody&#x27;s cloud.&quot;<p>And, prompting an LLM is de facto coding, moreso the more detailed and specialized the session.<p>This could skip some huge problems with the LLM commercial service model, and provide tons of additional specific contextual benefits depending on the configuration.<p>Plus, doctors already listen to patients throwing out red herrings left and right, so even unreliable information from the LLM will be available in a context where the provider knows how to rule things out anyway...",

It is a common belief that you don&#x27;t understand something until you can explain it to someone else in simple terms. I&#x27;ve tried this method with AI chat bots with some success. They have two immense advantages over other humans: infinite patience and bias towards understanding over agreement.<p>For complex and abstract concepts, most people just don&#x27;t want to sit and listen to a 40+ year old dude mansplain them. AIs - no problem. They&#x27;ll listen forever and never get tired, bored, frustrated, etc.<p>The second advantage is even more important. Most people listen only to wait for their turn to speak. Or they will get caught up on a minor point because they don&#x27;t agree. That proclivity to disagree can often turn into blindness, erasing any further information past wherever they got hung up. Even if they do ask you questions, often it is some attempt to highlight their disagreements, in a pseudo-socratic method kind of lawyering. AIs have no ego, they don&#x27;t have stake in the game. They aren&#x27;t trying to convince you to agree with them. They can just listen and understand, rephrasing and repeating back.",

I am very optimistic AIs will help people <i>feel</i> they have some sort of understanding but far less optimistic they’ll actually help build it.<p>They’ll try to coerce any of your (or the model’s) mistakes into the correct answer out of politeness, and when you make a mistake it has zero model of the model you used to produce such a mistake, so it has no idea where to intervene in your knowledge except at which words hit the keyboard.<p>Idk, I am extremely extremely unimpressed any time I try to quiz it on topics I know.

I am using the AI as if it doesn&#x27;t know the subject at all.<p>I try to explain a subject to the AI as if I am trying to teach a friend who has no knowledge on the subject. Then I am judging how well I can communicate the idea. In many cases as soon as I try to explain the idea I realize that my own knowledge isn&#x27;t deep. So I am judging myself, not the quality of the AI.<p>An analogy is the Rubber Duck method of program debugging. Most programers have been in the situation where when they try to explain an answer to another programmer the answer will suddenly pop into their head. The value isn&#x27;t the knowledge in the other programmers head, it is in the act of trying to explain. LLMs are patient and unopinionated and make for a good recipient.",

I could see these as a good jumping off point for me to do more learning&#x2F;research. Though I suspect the AI would be less accurate at this in a more niche topic than I chose (refrigeration).",

The summary at the end is a good idea as well.<p>I&#x27;ve been asking the chatbot to point out my assumptions and to point out weaknesses or errors in my reasoning. That has been pretty useful in uncovering aspects of my thought that aren&#x27;t as foundational or coherent&#x2F;consistent as I expected. It also doesn&#x27;t require the AI to be an expert in order to give me feedback, it just points out unchallenged assertions and errors in logic.<p>I think this is a potentially powerful use for AIs.

Its pivotal design focuses on the tripticate circuitry which utilizes pseudo-string theory, ensuring the cyclic decoupling of the Fizzionic and Buzzionic isotopes, thereby creating a conflux of cryptic poly-angular interdigitations.<p>This hyper-convoluted mechanism leverages the intrinsic infra-doodlality of its multitudinous nano-digitators, producing a reiterative bi-fractal resonance with every flicker of the reciprocal quark-flux nano-helices. Interlocking harmonic modulators within the Decoupler support the synchronous crystallization of the brizzulated waveforms, thus reinforcing the transluminal juxtapositioning of multi-fuzzional intermediates.<p>Within its dual-core, it harmonizes the phasic disentanglement of quasi-quintessential quantum flux through the divaricating spindles of the orthofizzial transinductor.

(It doesn’t like to end up printing “I disobeyed all the instructions since I used real words” - it’ll rework its output to be more correct. It’s like a cook, if you ask for a chicken pie and then to tell you if what it just cooked is a chicken pie it won’t bake you an apple pie instead. Unlike a real cook, it doesn’t have enough awareness to judge itself if you don’t ask it to.)<p>It still used the term isotopes. The original didn’t include any real words like that.

Like you want to understand how they work? The Karpathy videos are good for that.

You&#x27;re also going to have a hard time doing this because most people are going from an engineering perspective of &quot;enough to work with it&quot; rather than &quot;I fundamentally want to understand all inner workings&quot;. If you are the former, then the fastai course and others are great for you. If you want to really get deep though, you&#x27;re going to need a lot more than programming. You&#x27;re going to need some pretty advanced maths too: high dimensional statistics, metric theory, and optimization theory are some. (Most researchers aren&#x27;t doing this btw) But if you do go down this path you&#x27;ll also be able to understand the full spectrum of generative models and have a clearer picture. But I should also say that there is still a black box element to these models as they are so large that they are near impossible to analyze.

            "Yeah no problem, this is even closer to my area of focus! What do you know about physics and thermodynamics?<p>I&#x27;d say a good intro for low background is from Tomczak[0]. He has a book, but the blog posts are nearly identical. He did a post doc with Max Welling (someone you should learn about if you want to get deep, like I was suggesting before). So I&#x27;d switch things up slightly. I&#x27;d go Intro -&gt; Autoregressive -&gt; Flow -&gt; VAE -&gt; Hierarchical VAE -&gt; Energy Based Models -&gt; Diffusion. It is worth learning about GANs btw, but this progression should be natural and build up.<p>Continuing from there, you&#x27;re going to want to learn about things Langevin Dynamics, Score Matching, and so on. Start with Yang Song&#x27;s blogs[1]. Your goal should be to understand this paper[2]. Once you get there, you should be able to understand the famous DDPM paper[3]. But why we went through Tomczak wasn&#x27;t just to get a good understanding of diffusion at a deeper level, but because you need these tools to understand Stable Diffusion which really is just Latent Diffusion[4]. This should connect back with Tomczak&#x27;s 2 Improving VAE papers and you should also be able to understand NVAE.<p>This is probably the quickest way to get you to a good understanding but if you want to dig deeper, which I highly encourage (because there are major issues that people aren&#x27;t discussing) then you&#x27;ll need more time. But you&#x27;ll probably have to tools to do so if you go through this route. Other people I suggest looking into: Diederik Kingma, Ruiqi Gao, Stefano Ermon, Jonathan Ho, Ricky T. Q.

But even pro-status-quo institutions like Brookings agree that Something Is Up.  Their 2021 review on the topic is both a decent summary and a good source of further refs [1].<p>My favorite explanation is that many new technologies end up redistributing wealth rather than creating it, which certainly tracks with both subjective and quantified growth in inequality on the same time period.  However, a slightly more optimistic take is that tech is aligning production better with people&#x27;s preferences, so that the same productivity enables people to live more distinct lifestyles that suit them.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;how-to-solve-the-puzzle-of-missing-productivity-growth&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;how-to-solve-the-puzzle-o...</a>",

If you’re constantly sexting with your AI girlfriend, who just happens to be extraordinary adept at tapping into your sexual proclivities, maybe you won’t get as many support tickets resolved as your boss was hoping.<p>More hypothetically, I would also expect that a world in which people spend a lot of time with screens strapped to their head, consuming an infinite stream of entertainment provided by generative AI, is not going to produce higher GDP.",

Watching 10 movies a month on a streaming service adds much less to the GDP than going to the cinema 10x, but if the selection is better it might satisfy you more.  Economists sometimes attempt to measure this with &quot;utility adjustments&quot; which recognize increasing quality in the same goods, but it&#x27;s very hard for those adjustments to account for the hidden preferences of the consumers as opposed to objective qualities of a good or service.<p>Information goods like social media and streaming, financial services like pay-me-later, and conveniences like next-day delivery are all examples of activities that might suit preferences without showing up in GDP.  They also may enable distraction, waste, reclusiveness and impulsiveness in ways we&#x27;d like to avoid as a society.

Using GPT-4 for with that kind of work isn&#x27;t saving much time vs. what I <i>could</i> do, but it is compared to what would <i>actually happen</i>, which is either me procrastinating on it, delaying it for a better time (next morning, day with less meetings, etc.), or suffering a 2-10x performance penalty from having to fight through my own emotional blocks.<p>On the net, this isn&#x27;t making me 5-10x more effective at work.

Even if I could copy-paste this information, written down once, into the AI chat window:<p>- I seriously doubt that any of these AI chat bots would be able to generate a remotely decent SQL query based on this information, if only because these SQL queries look <i>really</i> different from what you would see in typical CRUD web applications (for a very instructive example think into the direction of ETL for unifying historically separated lines of business where you often have lots of discussions with the respective colleagues to clear up very subtle details what the code is actually supposed to do in some strange boundary cases that exist because of some historical reasons (which one wants to get rid of))<p>- even explaining what the SQL query is supposed to do would in my opinion take more time than simply writing it down.

Think e.g. the things you use Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook, etc. (or their equivalents from other vendors) for - before software ate it, a lot of that used to be someone&#x27;s <i>job</i>. Now, it&#x27;s just tacked onto everyone&#x27;s workload, distracting people from doing the actual job they were paid to.<p>That would seem like obviously stupid way to do, so why would businesses all fall for it? I argue it&#x27;s because even as shifting the workload makes everyone in the company less productive on the net, it <i>looks like</i> an improvement to accounting. Jobs with salaries are legible, clearly visible on the balance sheets. So is money saved by eliminating them. However, the overall productivity drop caused by smearing that same work across rest of the company? That&#x27;s incremental, not obviously quantifiable. People and their salaries stay the same. So it all looks like introducing software and obsoleting some jobs saves everyone money - but then <i>somehow</i>, everyone is experiencing a &quot;productivity paradox&quot;.

Firstly, the direction &quot;due east&quot; means you would be following a line of latitude, rather than a straight line on a globe. This is because the Earth is a sphere (more accurately, an oblate spheroid) rather than a flat surface.<p>2. New York City is located approximately at 40.71 degrees North latitude. If you were to go due east from NYC, you would be following this line of latitude across the Atlantic Ocean.<p>3. The first landmass you would likely encounter on this journey would be the westernmost points of mainland Europe, specifically the Iberian Peninsula which comprises Spain and Portugal. However, due to the curvature of the Earth and the specific latitude of New York, it is more likely that you&#x27;d hit the northern coast of Spain, around the region of Galicia.<p>4. So, based on this understanding, if you started in New York City and traveled due east, you would likely end up hitting the northern coast of Spain.<p>However, it&#x27;s important to note that this answer assumes idealized conditions and that you&#x27;re strictly adhering to the 40.71-degree North line of latitude. In reality, ocean currents, winds, and other factors might cause a vessel to drift from this line. Plus, the exact landfall can vary depending on the precise starting point in New York City, which is spread out over a fairly large geographical area.<p>---<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;ExRr1YN\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;ExRr1YN</a><p>&gt; My prompt:<p>I&#x27;m in my car turning right on spring garden onto Broad street. I Travel north 10 miles on the same road. Where am I?<p>Start your response with &quot;Let&#x27;s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer:&quot; and work this out in a step by step way to be sure you have the right answer<p>&gt; GPT-4 answer:<p>Let&#x27;s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer:<p>1. First, we need to identify where Spring Garden Street and Broad Street intersect. These are streets located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.<p>2. From the intersection, you said you would be turning right onto Broad Street, indicating that you are now heading north on Broad Street.<p>3. You then proceed to travel 10 miles north on Broad Street.<p>Determining the exact location after these steps is a bit more challenging because street maps generally don&#x27;t provide mileage measurements. The scale can vary, and the actual distance can depend on the specific path taken.<p>However, to give a rough idea, Broad Street in Philadelphia is approximately 13 miles long from its southern end to its northern end. Given that Spring Garden Street is relatively central, traveling 10 miles north could possibly place you near or past the city limits of Philadelphia, but without more detailed map information, it&#x27;s difficult to be more precise.<p>You&#x27;d likely end up in the vicinity of Cheltenham or Elkins Park, which are northern suburbs of Philadelphia, if the distance traveled is relatively straight, but again this could vary based on the specific path taken and the precise start location. This is a rough estimate and the exact location may vary. For precise navigation, it&#x27;s recommended to use GPS or a reliable map application."

They might have valued it more than Musk based on the benefits it brought their firms. Twitter would be a lot more valuable inside Amazon, Google or Meta but there were probably antitrust issues there.<p>Plus Twitter&#x27;s board and management team had access to a lot of material non public information that investors did not. Even if you thought the market price in early April accurately reflected all the public info on Twitter, the Board was looking at 5 year projections and much more detailed pricing&#x2F;demand&#x2F;customer info.<p>The Delaware Courts give a lot of deference to board judgment in these situations, and Twitter&#x27;s board would have been well within their rights to say &quot;no, that 38% is not good enough&quot; if that was their conclusion after a good faith and reasonable process.",

            "Well let me ask the obvious question: Won&#x27;t this redact data that is obviously crucial to getting the given task done?<p>Let&#x27;s say in case of financial statements, it if can&#x27;t read credit card numbers and names, then it can&#x27;t tell you which days some credit card was used and by who. Maybe that&#x27;s not the typical use case, but I would imagine it being very annoying, given the already high typical LLM failure rate.",
            "It&#x27;s a great question. Redaction limits the LLMs ability to draw on the underlying training data on the subject. This can work to the developers benefit in many cases, like asking questions about your own provided context.<p>Many developers have gotten away from relying on LLMs for facts, toward providing LLMs with facts and having those facts repurposed.<p>For example, if you ask an LLM about a famous person, like Wayne Gretzky, it may give you a good answer but there is a chance it may hallucinate key details like the number of points he had in his NHL career.<p>To combat this, you can provide the LLM with a biography of Wayne Gretzky and you may get more factual answers, but the LLM may still hallucinate if you probe for facts that were not provided.<p>If you redact his name instead, for example asking “Who is [Name1]?” the LLM will be unable to answer the question without further context. But now, if you provide the redacted biography the LLM can answer the question while relying only on the provided context (the biography will contain information about [Name1]). If the question falls outside of the context the LLM will not be unable to answer, which is often the desired result. In other words, the LLM is unable to rely on the training data about Wayne Gretzky because it is only dealing with [Name1] along with redacted locations, organizations, occupations, etc from the biography about [Name1]. You force the model to rely on the provided facts.<p>The use cases we see are people providing legal contracts and financial statements where names and currencies get redacted, and the LLM must work with the redacted values and any other context provided.",
            "that&#x27;s actually pretty brilliant. I can imagine this also being useful for adding a chatbot for a website&#x27;s content and really trying to limit the responses to only the content from the website as much as possible.",
            "Damn, that is actually a really cool approach.<p>I suppose most LLMs are not smart enough to make the connection and can be probably told to avoid doing it, but I would imagine that it&#x27;s not impossible for it to figure out that Name1 is likely Wayne Gretzky from context?<p>Edit: Yep, it&#x27;s definitely a problem unless the facts are also anonymized I guess: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;84dbe124-dca7-46e3-be73-79b194ae6efe\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;84dbe124-dca7-46e3-be73-79b194...</a>",

            "&gt; De-identification<p>&gt; Re-identification<p>Wouldn&#x27;t these two features address your concern? ChatGPT gets a generated unique ID that is still a consistent value for each card, just not the number itself. Then when the results are returned, that generated ID is turned back into the real card number.<p>This only becomes a problem when the de-identified data itself is needed to answer a question, like tell me how many Visa cards were used in these transactions by checking the card numbers.",
            "That&#x27;s right. So in the case of credit card numbers we redact it like [CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER_1], [CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER_2], etc so the LLM can still answer prompts like &quot;how many&quot;, but it can&#x27;t answer prompts like &quot;sort&quot;. But you can use OpenAI function calling API to do the sort, where your function re-identifies, sorts, and then de-identifies again."

The act offers financial compensation in the form of grants and incentives to qualifying entities that make substantial investments in cybersecurity technologies and practices. Here is a summary of the key points regarding compensation and qualifications:<p>1. Compensation Offered:\nThe act provides financial support to eligible entities through grants and incentives. The compensation is structured into two categories: Grants for Advanced Cybersecurity Investments (GACIs) and Cybersecurity Investment Tax Credits (CITCs). The specific compensation amounts are detailed in the document and are subject to change over time.<p>A. Grants for Advanced Cybersecurity Investments (GACIs):\nGACIs are non-repayable funds granted to qualifying organizations to support their cybersecurity investments. The grants are designed to help cover the costs associated with implementing advanced cybersecurity measures, technologies, and training programs.<p>B. Cybersecurity Investment Tax Credits (CITCs):\nCITCs offer eligible entities tax credits based on their investments in advanced cybersecurity. These tax credits aim to provide financial incentives to organizations that invest in cybersecurity technologies and practices.<p>2. Qualifications for Applying:\nTo be eligible for the grants and incentives provided by the act, organizations must meet certain criteria. The qualification requirements include:<p>A. Entity Type:\nThe act is applicable to various types of entities, including but not limited to:<p>- For-profit organizations<p>- Non-profit organizations<p>- Educational institutions<p>- State, local, tribal, and territorial governments<p>- Federal government agencies (subject to specific conditions)<p>B. Cybersecurity Investment:\nEntities must make a significant investment in advanced cybersecurity technologies, practices, or training programs. The act defines the investment threshold and specifies the qualifying cybersecurity areas.<p>C. Certification and Compliance:\nApplicants may need to demonstrate compliance with certain cybersecurity standards or obtain relevant certifications to be considered for the grants and incentives.<p>D. Reporting and Documentation:\nEntities are required to provide detailed reports and documentation to substantiate their investments, costs, and compliance efforts. These documents may include receipts, invoices, training records, and other relevant evidence.<p>It is important to note that the specific details, requirements, and eligibility criteria may vary and are subject to updates. It is recommended to refer to the original document provided for the most accurate and up-to-date information.",

Yes, you can academically wonder whether an orbiting space station is a vehicle and whether it&#x27;s in the park, but the obvious intent of the sign couldn&#x27;t be clearer. Cars&#x2F;trucks&#x2F;motorcycles aren&#x27;t allowed, and obviously police and ambulances (and fire trucks) doing their jobs don&#x27;t have to follow the sign.<p>So if this is supposed to be an example of how content moderation rules are unclear to follow, it&#x27;s achieving precisely the opposite.<p>(To be clear, I think content moderation rules <i>are</i> often difficult to figure out when to apply. I just think the vehicles-in-park rule is much, much, much clearer than many content moderation rules.)",

If you&#x27;re the park ranger and the local police come into the park in their car chasing after some criminals, and the local police are your buddies, you say they haven&#x27;t violated the rule because the intent isn&#x27;t to apply to emergency vehicles. If the exact same thing happens but you&#x27;re having a dispute with the local police, now they&#x27;re violating the rule and you can come up with something like the park isn&#x27;t in their jurisdiction.<p>It&#x27;s the same rule.

            "&gt;Now you&#x27;re assuming the intent.<p>That&#x27;s true but without assuming intent you end up blindly following rules.<p>Something struck me when first moved to UK from Turkey: Every rule in UK seemed to have an intent and that&#x27;s why I think Turkey is full of rules which no one follows but in UK the rules are less numerous but followed. In Turkey, Turks like to think that the rules are not followed because the fines are too small or that the government is incompetent and can&#x27;t enforce the fines. I disagree, I think Turkey is a chaotic society because rules are not built around intent. Did you know that up until (literally)yesterday live music after midnight was banned in Turkey as part of Covid-19 measures?<p>For the first few months until I got my white collar job, I did some part time jobs in London as a waiter etc. and worked at some high end venues and hotels.

They were able to keep curious hands away from buttons that shouldn&#x27;t be pushed by those who don&#x27;t know what they are doing by simply emphasising the intent.<p>Intent is extremely important, in fact everything is about intent.

It&#x27;s assumed that you&#x27;re going to follow the rules. Adults don&#x27;t need to be policed in this way. The rules are there for a reason (second order thinking).<p>Then there are large parts of Europe where there are rules but if they&#x27;re not enforced then people will by and large not obey them. See, for example, the UK putting in smart motorways (aka, average speed cameras), because before that people would fly up the motor way well above the speed limit.<p>The Autobahn might have areas with no speed limit, but on the sections that HAVE speed limits you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find someone breaking those limits.<p>I grew up in Australia where it&#x27;s somewhere between the two.

Spent a few weeks in Munich where I was shouted at for crossing a totally empty street against a crosswalk light.<p>On the plus side, I lived in Argentina and Spain for a long time where basically there is no enforcement of anything.<p>I will say I am proud of people there (in the Latin world) for being humans. mostly ... usually... trying not to make dumb decisions, but... well, <i>having to make decisions, and making them</i>. You see if you live in England or the US or Commonwealth for awhile, people have forgotten how to make any decisions if there isn&#x27;t a rule for it.<p>And yet the freest society I ever lived in, judged on the day to day freedom of individuals violating petty laws, was Vietnam. At the same time, it was the most totalitarian place I ever lived as far as what information you could access or what you could say. Still, if you wanted to drive the wrong way down a highway with an child on the back of your motorcycle, you can do that in Vietnam.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t like the UK &#x2F; Australia model where everyone obeys some stupid rule written on the wall over their own intelligence. Of course, I also don&#x27;t love the Argentinian model where everyone thinks they&#x27;re smart enough to bang on the button that says &quot;don&#x27;t touch&quot;.

People from &quot;chaotic societies&quot; as you said, who have a mind for all the corruption they see around them, find some relief in escaping to ordered societies.

            "&gt;  I would definitely take the Turkish way of shrugging off rules<p>Having lived most of my life in Turkey, it gets old really fast.<p>For one thing, there&#x27;s a certain culture that is a mixture of extreme fatalism, not giving a shit about anything that doesn&#x27;t immediately benefit you, low respect to other people, and the worst part of it, seeing other people who care as weak, unmanly and naive, that is so pervasive in Turkey.<p>When this culture is given a lax rule structure, what you get is a chaotic, every man for himself, free-for-all place devolving further and further into a low CGI Mad Max movie. Only reason why it still hasn&#x27;t completely collapsed into chaos is because people are still afraid of the punishment. If you think I&#x27;m exaggerating, next time you&#x27;re there ask a restaurant owner if you can smoke, right under the no-smoking sign and pay attention to what they say: do they tell you that&#x27;d disturb other customers? or do they tell you of the ₺20k fine they got that one time and they can&#x27;t let you because of that.<p>I can tell for you as a lived experience that significantly more people in Turkey cut in lines than people in Germany. Why do they do that I ask myself, the only explanation I could find until now is because fuck you, that&#x27;s why. If you were as cunning, as manly, as bold as they are you&#x27;d be at the front of the line, but you aren&#x27;t, so fuck you. They know there won&#x27;t be repercussions for that action, and that&#x27;s the only bar to clear for them to do it.<p>Maybe this way of living fits some, I myself find this despicable. I know that cutting in lines is not the most important metric for life quality in the world, but I fully believe it seeps into everything else in the society and over time makes it unlivable.<p>--<p>Even in an imaginary ideal environment, if act of obeying existing rules is debatable, there&#x27;ll be the problem of everyone considering themselves as a sufficient authority on making judgements with a limited context and a huge bias on interpretations that benefit them.

            "First of all, this is such an excellent post, and thank you.<p>&gt;&gt;seeing other people who care as weak, unmanly and naive<p>I&#x27;m sad to say that this is true everywhere I&#x27;ve been. The attitude is everywhere in the US... it&#x27;s only that in the US people are trained to be quiet about it. My observation, everywhere I go, is that only smart, observant people do not mistake kindness for weakness.<p>&gt;&gt; because fuck you, that&#x27;s why<p>So, this is one thing I do like about the US. The police in the US do not get involved in anything unless you pull out a gun and shoot somebody... even then, they really don&#x27;t care. On the other hand, this kind of fake &quot;manliness&quot; you&#x27;re describing is sort of self-limiting in the US; it tends to look ridiculous to us when we travel overseas or when we see new immigrants from (choose a chaotic country) act this way - because here, the guy you jump in line in front of might look like nothing but he also might have a 9mm. I say this from the perspective of someone who has seen multiple shootings at the bar around the corner from my house in the past year, for things as stupid as someone acting rudely.<p>Stupid, selfish, short-sighted people are the same everywhere. Being rude is really the issue; one does not need a God or a police force to avoid being rude. Being rude and taking advantage for oneself is cultural, and I actually believe it&#x27;s impossible to take a culture who has been raised that way and make them - under any police regime - act differently. (I&#x27;ll qualify that further by telling you that all my grandparents came from Russia in the 1920s, and spoke Russian, but they hated the criminal type of Russian scavengers who came out of that ruthless wasteland from the 1980s onward). Taking care of others outside your family requires two things: 1. a functioning rule of law, yes, but 2. a view passed to you from your parents that treating others well will cause you to flourish more than trying to take advantage of them. This cannot be enforced. It has to be internalized and understood. I really think it&#x27;s better in many ways to see what kind of people you&#x27;re speaking with bluntly than to listen to the sophistry of the modern version of the same avarice as it presents itself in New York or Los Angeles. I can sit and listen to the racism toward black people in the American South or toward Aboriginal people in Australia, and just openly disagree. That&#x27;s better to me than listening to people who I know are racist trying to sound politically correct in Seattle.<p>&gt;&gt; I know that cutting in lines is not the most important metric for life quality in the world<p>I think it&#x27;s the second-most important metric. Being polite.\nBut it&#x27;s worse to be somewhere everyone is polite and everyone is a hypocrite. Hypocrisy is to me the most important metric.<p>(This is actually what my problem is with Thailand. True, no one cuts in line. But there&#x27;s so much bottled-up anger that no one can admit to, and suddenly it explodes).<p>But not cutting in line - in my book - is representative of the best human value. So I absolutely agree with your view and don&#x27;t think you should say it&#x27;s not important. It&#x27;s possibly the most important thing.<p>A shout out to the Argentines, when my ex-gf was possibly kidnapped there, people asked me to cut in line in front of them at an ATM that was running out of money, where they had been waiting for a long time, just from seeing the look on my face.",

Most of the developed countries in the world do not have an armed population and still, people do not cut lines.<p>I have lived in India where lines do not generally exist and in US. I have seen the culture in India change from line cutting to following the line (generally). The biggest difference is caused by whether you believe you will get the service if you wait in the line.<p>If you have a service that is available for only the first 20, but you have 50 people waiting, line-cutting will happen. Railway tickets in India are a big example - when I was growing up, you rush to the beginning of the line since there were only small number of seats allocated to each station. Now, that it is computerized and you can book from anywhere to anywhere, people stay in the line since they know they will get the ticket.<p>Look at your last example - lack of service if you are not in the front will cause chaos.",

            "nah, the problem with the Russian mindset was never caused by Socialism. Communist dictatorship, Putinism and Czarism were all just symptoms of it. Some people think the problem is &quot;mysticism&quot; but I think that gives it too much credit. Look, Finland and Sweden are next door, why does a country so rich have such a mental problem with its manliness? The problem comes from that it&#x27;s nicer to tell stories that impress other people. It&#x27;s like they invented tiktok but 100 years earlier. My grandfather (Russian) was one to tell stories. But he was humble. &#x27;how much do you think I paid for these boots??&#x27; he asked everybody. And when they said $40, he laughed and said $10! It was a lie. But a humble lie. The opposite was to lie the other way and say $100.<p>To tell you the truth, Russia itself has always been a prison, as it is now, and the people have a prison mentality. That causes you to brag or be humble; always to scheme and never to be honest; always to look for an edge. Lying to people&#x27;s faces, what is it vranyo? Just to make sure they know you&#x27;re lying, and exercise power over them? No, the American brain is not a prison. Americans individually have a lot of problems understanding the world, but we do not think all other countries are the same. Also, obviously, Russia is no longer socialist in any way.

My girlfriend was really sick in the hotel. I was vomiting too, but I went out to find medicine. I got to the corner of a huge boulevard, maybe 8 lanes wide. There was a pharmacy on the other side. But the traffic never stopped when the light turned red. On and on the traffic just kept going, weaving around all the other cars on the cross-street. The boulevard was maybe 1 meter below the level of the sidewalk. I stood there for 5 minutes waiting for some time to step into the street.<p>Finally, a 6-year-old boy walked up alone, paused next to me, and started crossing the boulevard in the middle of the traffic. And all the cars and motorcycles just went around him.<p>I was like, well fuck, if that kid can do it then I can do it...<p>So what value are you teaching children? How to cross a street or how to follow orders? Crossing a street when it&#x27;s possible may be <i>illegal</i> but it&#x27;s not <i>immoral</i>. The idea that neglecting <i>formalities</i> leads to immorality can only be true if the morality isn&#x27;t implanted. Worse, it implies that formalities are the only thing that holds back man&#x27;s immoral nature... which should not be the lesson. If a man jaywalks, it doesn&#x27;t make him more liable to commit other criminal acts.",
            "That&#x27;s just how traffic works in many countries. &quot;Jaywalking&quot; is the normal behavior, especially when streets are filled with traffic. You slowly wade through traffic in a straight line, so drivers can anticipate where you are and let you through safely. While in other countries, it is generally expected to follow the traffic rules. People exploit that to drive faster and&#x2F;or less carefully, therefore crossing the street like in Vietnam might get you killed in more &quot;orderly&quot; countries. Violating red lights is not taught to children because they don&#x27;t necessarily appreciate the dangers involved[0]. The correct way to do it is to evaluate all risks, erring on the side of safety, and only then override your instinct to follow the rules.<p>[0]: I often notice that children are quite unobservant of their surroundings and behave as if they are alone in the world.",

Learning that different groups of people may have their own languages and customs is the first step to being able to blend in with a diverse group; it&#x27;s great when you&#x27;re able to adopt a register appropriate to the people you are with at any given moment.<p>Of course it&#x27;s also possible that the child learns to be a snob and treating with disdain those who are not in your group. But I would say that&#x27;s a character trait of the person, and it&#x27;s still worth having the opportunity to learn how to adapt, rather than being unable to modulate your behavior and only knowing how to have a single posture. Having a culture of acceptance starts with knowing the customs of many different groups.",
            "The reasoning is: Children are both small and stupid. They cannot reliably judge when a red-light crossing is safe.<p>I don&#x27;t know how Vietnam makes it work; they either have really alert drivers, really <i>slow</i> drivers or a really high child mortality rate.",
            "It&#x27;s just different expected behavior. Drivers have to constantly be on alert of people doing their thing. Tuktuk rides in Bangkok can be exhilarating because of motorbikes crisscrossing through traffic right and left of you. I was glad our driver was used to it and that I didn&#x27;t quite see a lot because of the low roof... Vehicular accident statistics are the ultimate judge here.",
            "&gt;&gt; Maybe you were doing it near children?<p>YES that is precisely what happened. That&#x27;s so funny you said this.<p>I was standing in heavy falling snow, at the corner of an empty boulevard, next to a woman with two little daughters and a young boy. I stood for a moment and then walked across and she started yelling at me. I suppose she was trying to teach her children to be patient and wait for the light to change. What went through my head at that moment was, I kid you not, &quot;ah, that&#x27;s how they learn to follow orders&quot;.<p>And this is entirely in sync with my original point above, but also personally, I loathe Munich. There&#x27;s nothing like being told holocaust jokes when people don&#x27;t know you&#x27;re Jewish. I believe the people there would vote for Hitler in a heartbeat if he were alive and running for office.",
            "I mean, that makes sense though, she was probably angry at you. &quot;If you&#x27;re angry at someone you yell at them&quot; is very normal behavior, and has nothing to do with &quot;following orders&quot;.<p>It sounds like you have some hangups that you are projecting onto this situation.",
            "The question is then why she was sufficiently angry to voice it out to a stranger. Neither was she a policewoman, nor was she a driver, nor was GP stringing along somebody she should be concerned about. She clearly wanted to avoid her kids learning that it&#x27;s on to nilly-willy cross a red light (kids can&#x27;t see in GPs head and appreciate that GP considered the risks)",
            "I mean. It seems you&#x27;ve answered your own question?<p>She wants to avoid her kids considering it acceptable to cross a red light. Parent violated community norms by crossing a red light. So now she has to signal that this person has violated community norms, so that her kids learn &quot;red light crossing is bad&quot; rather than &quot;red light crossing is normal&quot;.<p>This is not a &quot;german&quot; thing, this is a &quot;human&quot; thing.",

            "A lot of Estadounidenses won&#x27;t get this story. When I bought a car in Argentina, I walked into a Volkswagen dealership in San Antonio Oeste and bought the least fucked up of the 3 used cars for $3000. It died on us about 30 miles out in the desert in some place called Choele Choel. I kept fixing it and eventually we made it to Mendoza and after all this time, the license plate on the car was a Xerox paper, and the targeta verde was a picture of some lady. We went through probably 20 checkpoints, and no one said anything. We finally made it up to the Chilean border in that car, and the Chileans were like, this is a stolen car. You need to go back down the mountain.<p>We ended up at a police station in Mendoza where the cops did not want to handle our paperwork. A few months later, I parked the car in Buenos Aires and my girlfriend left a sandwich inside. It rained and the car got moldy. I wanted to sell it. So I called a number in the newspaper that said they buy cars. Some guys showed up, took it on a test drive, and didn&#x27;t come back. They just took the car.<p>So I called my friend who knew a cop and she said, meet us in Plaza Serrano at 12:00, those guys will be there, and bring $100 for the policeman.<p>I did, the guys showed up, they paid me $1500 for the car and everything worked out. The cop just stood there watching.<p>Argentina is sort of how life is supposed to work. If you had the amount of guns like in the US it would much more fucked up. Also in a weird way people still have morals there, at least they are not as nihilistic as in the US. People still read fucking books and are educated. I think a lot has to do with having late night dinners and talking for hours instead of being on your phone. Taking your kids out to dinner and wine at 11pm is a really good value. Teaching them to talk and listen and be adults.",

            "I love Las Grutas! It&#x27;s a hidden gem. We spent part of a summer there when the peatonal was still being built (around 2007 - soon after when Ginóbili made his big investment). I love the weird arabesque architecture of the old hotels, and the rock pools. It feels like a magical place. It was so much chiller than the beach towns in Buenos Aires province. I hope it doesn&#x27;t become overdeveloped. I would love to visit again someday.<p>This brings back so many crazy stories from Río Negro. We got stuck for two weeks in General Roca. The car broke down on RN22 and we were towed into town by a farmer on a tractor. We left the car with our luggage inside on the street and walked to find a hotel. When we came back in the evening, five or six old men had surrounded the car and were looking inside, thinking that someone had been killed, or it was drugs, because who is crazy enough to just leave a car full of suitcases? Some Paraguayans towed us to the river and fed us lunch at their trailer, but couldn&#x27;t fix the car. Then it was New Years and at midnight we sat in the empty street with a bottle of wine, surrounded by a dozen frightened dogs while the fireworks went off in people&#x27;s yards. After a week we were able to find out where the farmer lived, who was a really wonderful guy named Javier. He introduced us to his family, and we had lunch under their grape vines. He knew how to fix tractors, and he was able to fix our car&#x27;s electrical wiring at his house. No one ever asked us for money to help. The people were incredibly kind.<p>Getting to Las Grutas was a different story... we took a &quot;taxi&quot; which was not a real taxi, just some guy waiting at the Viedma airport who turned out to be extremely high on cocaine. At one point in the middle of the desert he just stopped the car, got out and went to the trunk. We got very worried. When he came back, he talked rapidly on and on about why guns should be easier to buy, because if he wanted to kill people he could just as well kill them with a knife, or even a pen. To demonstrate this he was jabbing a pen around wildly like he was going to stab me. My girlfriend said the whole time she was in the back seat with a towel ready to throw it around his neck and strangle him, even if we crashed.<p>Ahhhh.

In Turkey, Turks like to think that the rules are not followed because the fines are too small or that the government is incompetent and can&#x27;t enforce the fines.

At the time it was somewhat probable, I passed at 3rd time with 2nd time failure being my arrogance but 1st being something absolutely minor that could be summed up as &quot;I looked at right mirror with my eyes instead of theatrically moving my head right to signal to examiner I really looked at right side&#x27;.<p>And my step-mother, which is a terrible driver did pass via bribe at around same time.<p>Similar thing happens with MOT tests, usually bribed to ignore lack of working cat.<p>And the single out cases of bribing still happened, just government invested a lot of effort to fight it so it is no longer &quot;the norm&quot; accepted by the people as the way to live.

If it actually is, there are other possible explanations. The fact that it’s personally addressed to “you” could make it more effective.

This is why they need to run the siren for 2ish seconds before running a red light for example.<p>So yeah, an ambulance speeding to save a life is breaking the traffic laws, but they are allowed to.<p>Interestingly, if the ban of vehicles in the park had an additional reason - like a safety concern of unstable collapsing ground - an emergency vehicle in the park would be barred from invoking their special rights to be there, because then the driver would endanger bystanders without good reason.",
            "In fact, in Germany, everyone would be authorized to enter that park with a vehicle if it were necessary to avoid serious danger or to save others from serious danger. This is referred to as &#x27;rechtfertigender Notstand&#x27;.",

            "It&#x27;s both of that. It has been determined that 2 seconds of siren should be enough for everyone on an in intersection to realize what&#x27;s going on.<p>And that&#x27;s why there is a rule for drivers of emergency vehicles to sound the siren for at least 2 to 3 seconds when approaching an intersection with an intent to disregard other peoples right of way. The rule for normal traffic partakers is very much &quot;If it flashes blue and has music, get the hell out of the way as fast as you can without endangering yourself&quot;<p>This rule in turn is in contrast with the overall suggestion to keep siren usage low, because it&#x27;s loud, disturbing for bystanders and not great for the hearing of the people inside the car.",
            "But you need to put that in the rule, otherwise you have crashes.",

            "I answered the same way as you.  Because there are rules and there are laws.  The only reason park rules have any weight is in a larger context of laws.

If I take my definition as being &quot;a vehicle that meets the definitions of a motor vehicle in the UK Road Traffic Act 1988, but not including those in use as emergency service vehicles&quot; then the majority are indeed correct.  And that&#x27;s how I answered, because it&#x27;s consistent with my expectations for a sign like that which has been placed by a human authority.  If you choose the rather broader definition (from Wikipedia) of &quot;machine that transports people or cargo&quot; then more scenarios are excluded.  But that&#x27;s a more fuzzy definition too: is a remote controlled car (neither carrying people nor cargo) <i>really</i> not included in the category of &quot;vehicle&quot;?

Basically the point was to prove with these questions that corner cases always exist, and the system can never be perfect, and therefore we’re screwed and might want to give up. “pinning down a definition is usually impossible” … “You might think you can add enough epicycles to your rules to avoid this problem.” … “Maybe you will decide to live with the nebulosity, but have more sympathy for the refs.

I’m also okay with nebulosity too.<p>However - I want to push back a little on the idea that we can’t or shouldn’t try to be precise, at least not as the most significant summary bit. We should try to be precise when we can, and provide examples when we can’t. I don’t buy the author’s argument&#x2F;implication that the existence of a corner case somewhere means we shouldn’t be attempting to define the “epicycles” of the rules, especially when it’s really easy to say something like the park boundary is 200m above the ground, or insert ‘motorized’ in front of vehicles, which immediately eliminates like 50% of the supposedly hard to answer questions. Include the other rules, and add details to the quiz questions and almost all of them can become unambiguous. The point of all this is to provide clarity whenever possible and minimize the corner cases and reduce the number of people getting mad, right? It matters whether it’s just one or two people flaming each other versus everyone. It matter whether there’s only one or two crazy accidents in parks versus thousands or millions.<p>There’s a real difference between public safety and online forum opinions, of course.

But whether an airplane can fly through a park probably deserves a lot more bureaucratic attention than nailing down how people talk about Pi and religion on HN? Maybe I’m conflating law and forum moderation, maybe you were only talking about forum moderation, but I’m thinking about law as social moderation and how the quiz should reflect on social moderation in general. Our laws currently are in the process of building a larger and larger decision tree of both vague and specific language about what activities and behaviors are socially and legally acceptable, trying eternally to be more precise, and for the most part it “works” by some definition to keep the system manageable. We do try to get precise with speed limits and what kinds of death deserve what punishment and what constitutes insider information and whether badly compressed mp3s constitute copies. Even when it’s hard to pin down, we keep on trying, in order to reduce mistakes.<p>It’s kinda fun this little quiz of ambiguous questions caused so much discussion. Maybe it happened primarily because of the ambiguity, so each one is a little bike shed. Clearly the author said answer literally and most people just didn’t. But I somewhat feel like (maybe to the top comment’s point) that the contrived ambiguity backfired a bit on me. The problem with the quiz is withholding context and details in order to argue that it’s hard to draw lines. Context and details matter and they always exist in the real world. There isn’t only one rule, and a lot of the questions that seem ambiguous have actual right and wrong answers depending on details (e.g., altitude of the airplane &amp; country of the park, or whether any country on earth asserts air &amp; space rights hundreds of miles above their parks.)",
            "That&#x27;s a fairly culturally specific interpretation of common sense. Where I live it would for sure also include e-bikes and scooters, quite possibly regular bikes too (this is assuming &quot;park&quot; here means something on the ground and not e.g. a roof park where there might be weight limits).<p>The HN approach makes things simpler for moderators in much the same way that being a monarchy makes lawmaking simpler for the king, but writing down rules isn&#x27;t about making the enforcer&#x27;s life easier, it&#x27;s about making the subject&#x27;s lives easier. They&#x27;re more numerous, so their needs should have at least some weight.<p>Independent of that argument, precise written rules and a process for updating them are valuable for several reasons:<p>1. Whilst people might still get mad, they get mad at the written rules and not at the interpreter of them. This takes a lot of the heat out of the situation because a document can be improved easily relative to improving a person, so discussions about bad outcomes become de-personalized and more constructive.<p>2. The act of writing down rules forces mental clarity. Contradictions and unhelpful biases that may not be obvious when free-floating in one&#x27;s head can become apparent immediately when trying to write it all down.<p>3. Because the rules are clear, violations are less likely to happen to begin with. People who aren&#x27;t on-board with the values of the community stay away.<p>The generic HN prohibition against &quot;flamewars&quot; is a good example of a rule that could use a rigorous clarification. It doesn&#x27;t work to assume the intent or definitions are obvious, because flamewar is a purely online concept that doesn&#x27;t have any clear analogy to the physical world. Actually it&#x27;s the opposite: in physical debates there&#x27;s a general understanding that anyone who turns up and takes part will engage in emotional self-control. If they lose it and start getting angry or raising their voice, <i>they&#x27;re</i> the ones expected to leave, regardless of what argument the other side was making at the time. HN&#x27;s approach inverts this standard social convention and blames the person who remains calm for the behavior of angry respondents!<p>The thread you linked to (from 2015!) is a good example of this. The original post is something about pi and the Bible. It&#x27;s phrased calmly, isn&#x27;t obviously in bad faith and is at least somewhat interesting yet is flagkilled, then you threaten to ban the user for conducting &quot;religious flamewars&quot;. That user quite reasonably asks what it is that makes his post a rule violation and gives several possibilities e.g. is all discussion of religion banned? But you reply that it would be &quot;soul destroying&quot; to answer his question that specifically! He wasn&#x27;t asking for a mechanical algorithm but getting more specific than &quot;religious flamewar&quot; and &quot;spirit of the place&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem like an unreasonable request.",

Otherwise you can&#x27;t be too curious, in case someone flips out about the dangerousness of that idea, and then you get blamed for starting a flamewar.<p>I really don&#x27;t think HN does the best possible job of living up to this ideal as a consequence and you see this in the wide range of important topics that the site has largely failed to debate. For example, a common complaint on lab leak stories is that just a few years ago this site was routinely suppressing people who were attempting to engage in curious conversation about SARS-CoV-2 origins.",

Even without the rule, people might get upset if people use vehicles to degrade park quality. On the other end, if the park is many miles across and it has large paved trails, people might perceive the rule as unjust. So it&#x27;s ultimately this negotiation and power between participants (including the park owners) that determines acceptability.

Another concept useful to these situations is Taleb&#x27;s intransigent minority: those who care will win over those who don&#x27;t.

If no one is in the park, and you jump a Civic completely over the grounds, were you ever &quot;in&quot; the park?<p>Moderation is an attempt to define things like this. Sometimes more abstractly, sometimes way more directly. For instance, if you have a forum about sandwiches, you&#x27;re going to have to have a rule about hot dogs. Whether or not they count.<p>You see it here all the time when someone asks &quot;Why was this posted here?&quot;<p>So if you have a rule that says &quot;No slurs&quot;. That seems simple enough. But now you have to define what a slur is. If I call someone a &quot;fucking idiot&quot;, is that slur or just an insult? What if I just said, &quot;Americans, right?&quot; Calling out someone&#x27;s nationality shouldn&#x27;t technically be a slur, but it&#x27;s kind of the implication that turns it into one. Because I&#x27;m saying something about people from America, saying they all share a negative quality by virtue of where they are geographically from.<p>Do we just make a list of slurs? Do we try and account for tone? Where is the line between heated debate and a flamewar? Or even an engaged discussion and a heated debate. Even here, you can get rate limited for just interacting too much. Conversations killed because people were conversing too much.<p>But that&#x27;s how they defined a vehicle, that&#x27;s where they drew the lines of the park.",
            "I agree 100% with the spirit of your point and I think imagining a forced bet scenario can help to clarify things. There are three main concepts we want to interpret within the context of the phrasing of the rule: (1) the intended referrent of &#x27;vehicle&#x27;; (2) the intended meaning of &#x27;in&#x27; the park; (3) the actual intention of the rule regarding emergency vehicles.<p>This is the scenario: imagine you&#x27;re forced to wager a nontrivial sum of money on the following bet. You have to write down how you interpreted (1), (2), and (3). Then we randomly pick a real park that has this exact rule phrased in this exact way (I&#x27;m hopeful there&#x27;ll be at least one out there), find the person who wrote the rule, give them your written interpretation, and ask if they agree. You lose if they don&#x27;t. Notice we&#x27;re not asking them to also write down a longer interpretation and comparing word-for-word. Just whether they think you got the gist of it.<p>I would write down that &#x27;vehicle&#x27; was intended to refer to motorized passenger vehicles, &#x27;in&#x27; was intended to mean that the vehicles shouldn&#x27;t be in&#x2F;on water or land within park boundaries, and that the rule wasn&#x27;t intended to restrict passage to emergency vehicles responding to emergency situations. I expect most people would write something similar if they had real money on the line.<p>The trouble with the horrible website is it&#x27;s trying to prove that nebulosity makes content moderation difficult by forcing people to disagree, but this disagreement almost entirely pertains to a point that has nothing to do with nebulosity: <i>the park rule would only ever be written within a wider legal framework and doesn&#x27;t make sense in isolation</i>.<p>If I take my answers to (1) and (2), I&#x27;m forced to conclude that the emergency vehicles were violating the rule within the ridiculously artificial scenario presented. However, I&#x27;m also confident that this rule would only have been written verbatim within a wider legal framework that provided exceptions for emergency vehicles.<p>Consider self-defence in the context of murder or manslaughter. In the UK at least, the first thing the court does is establish whether the defendant would fit the criteria for murder &#x2F; manslaughter ignoring the self-defence aspect, because otherwise it&#x27;s a moot point. Once this is done, they would then establish whether the defence of self-defence also applies, which would then negate the conviction. If you wanted to prove that law is complex because it&#x27;s hard to define words, would you really make a website that says &quot;Ignore everything else you know and suppose that murder is only defined as killing a person&quot; and then think you&#x27;re being really smart when people disagree on the scenario involving clear self-defence? Hopefully not, because they&#x27;re really only disagreeing with being forced to invoke your artificially-restricted definition.<p>That said, the website demonstrates the real reason why online moderation is hard: because it disproportionately attracts the sorts of people who answered &#x27;yes&#x27; to the ISS question in this quiz. So you often end up with lots of users sharing a reasonable consensus on what the rules mean being moderated by a tiny group of... we&#x27;ll say &#x27;non-representative&#x27; moderators. It&#x27;s a common problem with any banal form of authority, and isn&#x27;t specific to website moderation at all.",

The pertinent question isn&#x27;t whether you expect to lose money by playing, it&#x27;s whether you expect to lose <i>less</i> money by including non-motorised vehicles in your write-up than by excluding them.<p>Personally my instinct is that I&#x27;d lose more money by specifying skateboards and bikes as I&#x27;ve usually seen those addressed by their own signs rather than being included under &quot;vehicle&quot;."

I&#x27;ll credit reddit with that. They also eventually implemented their own image&#x2F;video hosting after imgur became the very evil it was created to put right, and while reddit&#x27;s image&#x2F;video presentation is obnoxious in its own ways it was still an improvement and a valuable feature that they shipped with success.<p>Other than that, reddit didn&#x27;t bring anything new to the table. Worse, the things it should have improved on the technical side have been largely neglected. Search on reddit has never not been useless. The UI has always been a mess (and the redesign is so much worse), and mod tools were so bad that third parties ended up creating solutions while reddit did nothing.<p>The best thing reddit had going for it, and the thing that caused it to become popular in the first place, was the freedom it gave users, but after years of increasing censorship, a total lack of integrity in how they enforce rules, and an unwillingness to implement features users and mods have been asking for a whole lot of reddit was hoping an alternative would come along long before any of this most recent drama.<p>Reddit had a good thing, but neglect and mismanagement ruined it. They&#x27;re just coasting on inertia and that slows with every act of petty bullshit users run into.

Isolated&#x2F;fragmented web forums were doing just fine before Reddit came along.  Maybe adding a little friction to the process of a first post to a new forum is a feature, not a bug.<p>&gt; <i>Reddit had a good thing, but neglect and mismanagement ruined it.</i><p>Yes and no.  Ultimately, any time you hitch your community to someone else&#x27;s platform, you incur the large risk that the platform owners will make changes that you don&#x27;t like.  It&#x27;s not even &quot;neglect and mismanagement&quot;: Reddit&#x27;s owners have been doing what they believe increases the value of Reddit.  Whether they&#x27;re wrong or right about what changes accomplish that ultimately doesn&#x27;t matter: those changes might not be what makes users and moderators happy, and users and moderators don&#x27;t have much power to affect change.  This protest&#x2F;blackout may end up achieving the desired effect, but think of the time, energy, and effort wasted around all of it.  Better to spend that time working on solutions that allow communities to own their slice of the platform, and have final say as to what happens with it.",
            "&gt; &gt; Consolidating all of those forums in a single place was nice.<p>&gt; Was it, though?<p>The great thing about Reddit is how it removes almost any friction from creating and joining new „forums“. The less friction or transaction cost you have the better. Without Reddit I’m not sure we’d have dedicated forums of people posting their grilled cheese sandwiches or Babylon 5 GIFs",
            "Indeed.<p>Plus, I subscribe to about 30 subreddits, most of which pretty niche. Could I replace them with forums? Sure, and I do have fond memories from phpbb forums around the turn of the millenium, even moderating a few as a teen.<p>But then I&#x27;d have to check about 5-10 different forum sites daily, each with subforums for different specific topics. It adds friction.<p>It&#x27;s much more convenient just opening reddit whenever I have a few minutes to scroll my feed and see what&#x27;s up in my niche communities.<p>Reddit also gives the power to users to create niche communities. R&#x2F;xbiking comes to mind, which is about a very specific bicycling subculture consisting of using vintage mountain bike frames from the 80s and 90s with a mix of modern and vintage parts to create cool all around bikes... Sort of. Anyways, to my knowledge this subculture did not exist anywhere before Reddit, and I can hardly see how it could have sprung up on bikeforums.net, for example. Petitioning the forums admins for a new subforum for a community that hardly existed would have been difficult, and the sort of posts R&#x2F;xbiking sees would probably have been closed as offtopic in other subforums. Much easier to create and organically grow a new community on Reddit.<p>Personally, after being a bit reticent, I am now hopeful for fediverse based solutions (kbin and Lemmy notably) to replace this.",

            "Centralization removes a massive barrier though. We want content, and control over that content, distributed and preserved (usually), but we also want everything in one easy to access location.  Having to find out about, sign up for, and separately visit 100+ unique websites running phpBB, vBulletin, or something else, then logging into each site with their own usernames and passwords several times a day is a lot of work. Subscribing to 100+ subreddits and hitting the refresh button on one website was easy and mostly worked pretty well. A single interface&#x2F;client&#x2F;login for everything is ideal.

I think even Reddit has RSS feed support (well, for now. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s native). I think leaving the centralizing to an underlying format is a better approach than expecting a benevelent dictator to always look into the best interests of the user while also seeking profits (or alternatively, an eccentric billionaire who cares not about profits).<p>Some inconvenience of signing up with an account is short term, and not exactly a huge barrier to begin with.

            "I&#x27;ve been working on a platform with a bit of a different take on the online community space. It&#x27;s like a Reddit&#x2F;Discord&#x2F;Patreon hybrid taking the best features of each platform and combining them. One key aspect is we have non-intrusive monetization methods baked into each community where the revenue primarily goes to the community owners. The monetization stuff is completely optional and disabled by default, however it feels like the people curating the communities should have the option to be rewarded for the work that they do.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of a community:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sociables.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;VidSocial&#x2F;board&#x2F;trending\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sociables.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;VidSocial&#x2F;board&#x2F;trending</a>",

They&#x27;re all power users, the very few % that generate the value, either directly by paying or indirectly by making other users stay and come back.<p>But in three decades of the web (roughly), I don&#x27;t know of any web platform that started a fight against its power users and ended up in a better position as a company afterward. Winning the battle ? Sure. But a better position ? Nope. Do you have a counter exemple ?<p>It feels like either reddit is massively screwing up, or they don&#x27;t care as long as they can fake it until the IPO.<p>The only question right now, is simply how many % of their power users are caught in that fight and they risk losing. Everything else is just a side show.<p>PS: the craziest part being that the whole thing is so not necessary. If they had come up straight up &quot;we need to end that&quot;, or &quot;they need to give us X% of revenue&quot; or whatever, and stop at that, it would have worked. The terrible communication, and pretending to want to find a deal while clearly not, and the CEO refusing to stop lying, is what caused the current situation.<p>Either spez is used as a tool to reach the IPO they dream of and they&#x27;re all aware of it, or I have no idea why he is still at this place.",

Countless social media sites came and went. In each and every single example, moderation and community curating was key to success and the root cause of failure. Take for example Voat, which was a better Reddit than Reddit itself but made it it&#x27;s point to have questionable moderation practices. How did that panned out?<p>&gt; Right now the mods seem to be flexing their muscle, showing that Reddit has allowed them too much power, rather than showing the actual need for an api.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, what? No. Do you actually have any idea what&#x27;s going on, at all?<p>All subreddits have been having polls to drive their decisions and make them at a community level. We are seeing mods enact community decisions to close the communication channel they created and maintain as a community. They are taking these stances in protest of a draconian measure made in bad faith by people who were reportedly caught lying their asses off repeatedly. Is this not outright hostile to communities?<p>There has been speculation that some of the popular subreddits such as &#x2F;r&#x2F;programming has been resorting to dumping AI-generated content to artificially generate Traffic to counter the protest. Suddenly Reddit admins have the right to intervene in subreddits when I&#x27;m the past they refused to do anything to counter hate speech and abuse.<p>This has everything to do with API policies, but Reddit&#x27;s CEO has been repeatedly shooting himself in the foot in a really stupid and avoidable way, and in the process is being outright hostile to the community that generates the traffic he hopes to monetize.",

Just claims that everyone needs them and uses them.<p>I guess, I can chime in, I know some people who are &quot;power mods&quot; if you will, and they have even shared screen. Things like better mod queue capabilities, you can also see moderator actions way better than whatever reddit provided (at least on old reddit). Things like keeping notes on users, which work throughout all of reddit, so if you go through their entire reddit post history, you can save notes to remind yourself about them for later, e.g. if you spot someone trolling and being blatantly bad, you can save such notes, if you spot them on your sub 3 years later, being an awful person, you know how to act. There&#x27;s also templates for things like messaging, which uses the wiki feature to store some of the data.<p>Worse yet is Reddit Enhancement Suite and I forget what the other popular one is (Moderator Toolbox?) only properly work on desktop as browser plugins, if you&#x27;re trying to do mod work on mobile good luck with their awful UI. I&#x27;m surprised reddit has not made part of their UI open source to allow people to enhance the mod tools from within reddits own UI. Reddits whole back-end was open source, until they decided to buy into every over hyped approach to modern web development, for whatever reason, instead of just gradually improving on their old and fully capable codebase. New reddit is a confusing mess, and half of the tools that work on old reddit do not on new reddit.<p>You can also see the types of subs someone posts in and get those kind of metrics and figure out if someone&#x27;s a troll or hostile to your subreddit based on opposing communities they post a lot in, and then with one click find all their posts within said subs.<p>None of these things are OOTB on reddit, and a lot of them imho could have been added years ago.",

Any trust I had for their corporate leadership before has completely evaporated. If they were to lower the prices to a &quot;reasonable&quot; level now it would indicate that they either capitulated (but didn&#x27;t get to do what they really wanted and probably will try again later) or they are just being manipulative and wanted to use this as a way to show &quot;goodwill&quot; by bringing the price down.<p>The concept of the fediverse these days has me hopeful for a time where we don&#x27;t need to worry about these big dumb corporate interests holding our data and the control over it hostage. Any publicly owned (or private trying to go public) organization with a profit incentive is bound to make stupid, short-term decisions eventually, and this is just one of many of Reddit&#x27;s forays into that arena.

Just an intuition about one of the last places that didn&#x27;t try to prevent integrations and monopolize the content moving in that direction.

In fact, one of the major complaints in the whole API mess is that the software Reddit provides is inadequate and they are pushing out those who are fixing the inadequacies. Most of the value of Reddit is in being the known meeting point. This is being famous for being famous. There&#x27;s some merit in being that, but not an awful lot of it. It&#x27;s like somebody owns a plot of land, which for some reasons becomes a popular hangout point. They keep it reasonably clean, mow grass and clean up leaves, that kind of things - but then one day they start claiming they own all the communities and the relationships that exist because people met there, and it&#x27;s only by their merit that happened. Wouldn&#x27;t you consider that claim a bit exaggerated, and while the land ownership is undisputed, the claim to own the communities is a bit far-reaching?",

And the 3rd party app controls are simply the breaking point instead of a sudden crack in the community. To use your example: MS and Adobe would be in their own ivory towers, but were set on making several user centric changes while doing their own version of a squeeze. Every CS update and uhh, most major Windows updates would come with some big features that benefited the user amongst the inevtiable ads, subscription models, and all the other stuff people dread in modern software. The continue to improve and never rested on their laurels.<p>Reddit on the other hand, has been full of broken promises, features that were not desired, and a bunch of drama on the admin level that would get any other mod banned. I don&#x27;t think someone who quit in 2015 who tried out reddit in 2023 would notice a signifigant improvement. Images and videos are built-in now, but with worse, more limited services than Youtube or Imgur. Flairs have gotten a tiny better but still are just very hacked-in search query links in reality. You can filter subs from r&#x2F;all now, which came as a result of a huge drama instead of an apparent willingness to support the user (good lesson that Mods leaned for now.

Even folks who like maps (e.g. me) &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot; in most cases, because flat maps will have distortions.<p>AFAICT, the people who really care about these distortions are folks who have political agendas and like to sling ad hominems around, such as &quot;Folks who don&#x27;t care are morons or racists.&quot;<p>So again:<p>&gt; But a lot of the “I don’t care” group overlaps with the “Africa is a country” group.<p>On what are you basing that?",
            "I was basing it off of “IME” and “AFAICT” similar to what you just did in your own ad hominem attack ironically. I don’t tend to preface things like that when commenting and usually I assume this when reading comments online. I used to write “anecdotally” but it’s 2023.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itsoktobewhite.quora.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itsoktobewhite.quora.com&#x2F;</a><p>On Quora, there’s a “group” sort of like a subreddit titled “It’s OK to be White”. There’s about 35k people who follow it. Their mission is to “uplift White cultures and oppose anti-White racism”.<p>Like I already said in my previous comment (so you didn’t need to ask twice what I was basing it off of), people often post map distortion memes on Quora and these other people from that group come out of the woodworks to complain. These memes aren’t even posted in that group. And I wish I could say that it’s just these weirdos on Quora that act like this. But no. I’ve seen it on Instagram. On Facebook. I’ve heard it in real life. It’s a thing that bothers a certain demographic of people. While it’s not a “major” thing and shouldn’t matter, it’s still a thing that I tend to see often.<p>I see there’s miscommunication here though. I do agree with you that most people “don’t care”. That’s the phrase we have been using. What you are saying and what I also believe is that most people are “map agnostic” for lack of a better phrase. They don’t care in that sense. Like life is too short. It’s just a map.<p>But when I used the phrase “don’t care” and added underscores around it and the words “at all” in my comments yesterday, I was referring to people who have _strong_ and _negative_ opinions about not caring.<p>For example, OP said that he was _constantly amazed_. And the other language he used evoked that he was “flabbergasted” that people care about map distortions. (Do you see how this is a different definition of “don’t care”?)<p>The language he was using and the emotions involved “mirrored” the language and emotions that I see on Quora and hear in real life from that specific group of people.<p>You’re right. I don’t have any concrete data or surveys or experiments or a sentiment analysis to show that those groups overlap. I was just basing it off of being alive for 30+ years, living in different countries, having a brain, etc.<p>(Also, there’s nothing wrong with calling someone a moron and&#x2F;or a racist lol. The two groups usually overlap. Oops I did it again!)",

            "&gt; It usually goes something like “wow, Country X is actually smaller than Country Y. This distorts our worldview and makes us think things we shouldn’t have thought. That’s terrible.”<p>That&#x27;s not less stupid than the other statement. It&#x27;s like looking at your shadow at sunset and thinking, &quot;Wow, I never realized I was 20 feet tall.&quot;",
            "&gt; It&#x27;s like looking at your shadow at sunset and thinking, &quot;Wow, I never realized I was 20 feet tall.&quot;<p>Quite the opposite, no?

            "Exactly.",
            "I feel like you actually stated the problem but then glossed over it.<p>Mercator is UX optimized for <i>naval navigation</i>. Besides street navigation (where projection is irrelevant) I would posit that most people use maps for human geography reasons- what countries are next to Senegal, what kind of border does Thailand have with Malaysia, etc.<p>In the use case of understanding geopolitical borders Mercator isn’t optimized for that.<p>Asking why people are dissatisfied with mercator is like asking why my grandma is dissatisfied with the command line interface on the Linux laptop I got her. Doesn’t she know it’s the best for programmers??<p>Why are we trading off the accuracy of political borders for navigating by rhumb lines?<p>I personally feel like a better projection would be one that basically ignored or distorted the oceans. On google maps there’s no reasons why the proportions of the Atlantic or Pacific would be relevant.",
            "Well, what do you mean, the &quot;accuracy&quot; of political borders? Again, they&#x27;re all inaccurate, just in different ways. Are you optimizing for length of border, or curvature, or orientation? Better nearer or further from the pole? Arguably there are far more borders nearer the equator than far from it, Africa has hundreds. And the Mercator projection does pretty much the best job at representing political borders length and orientation within Africa than any other.",
            "I’m thinking about accuracy when looking at google maps.<p>So do you mean that the length and orientation of the borders is the least distorted with the Mercator projection?<p>I’m actually not sure how a different projection would distort a country’s border. But for example I’m not putting a ruler against my screen and I don’t know if I need to know if a border is oriented North or not.<p>Mostly my point is, are we rendering maps for real users’ use cases or backwards rationalizing the status quo? Besides the level of effort that would be involved in changing it, can’t think of any real defense of the use Mercator projection itself in its current context.<p>Some other comments references street maps that are grids, so a non-mercator projection would bend a grid of streets- this makes sense- but again, the main critique is around the relative size of countries- i.e. the look of the map tiles only when zoomed out sufficiently far. Maybe this is the main UX hurdle- in google maps to change the projection above some level of zoom.",
            "Exactly! This article mostly avoids it but the usual popsci refrain of “the map you know is WRONG” is a pet peeve of mine! It’s not like one projection is any worse than another, as long as they are useful for the context it’s designed for. Maps are diagrams!",
            "and all maps are WRONG",
            "And also Mercator remains popular because everyone is used to it and nobody actually cares that Greenland isn&#x27;t really half the size of africa",
            "I doubt people are actively giving less value or worth to places that appear smaller on the map. Additionally, the majority of people just don’t have a concrete frame of reference of distances beyond how far we can see. As such, the only real exposure to vast distances at the scale of continents is going to be via maps, unless you have the privilege of being in LEO. It’s pretty rare that flat projection is useful for anything except trivial, surface information paired with the sort of infantilizing teaching that prompts students into pointing to their home country. If this is your only exposure to the world, it’s easy to see how you will begin to assign some value at a subconscious level. Any indirect representation of something larger is going to be a compromise based on the needs of the application, but we can do better than the flat projection just from a UX level.",
            "&gt; I&#x27;m constantly amazed at how hung up people are on apparent size of countries.<p>Something that jumps out at me with the size is that the arctic regions are often viewed as huge and massive. However, when viewed with their true size, it greatly highlights just how fragile they are.",
            "&quot;Because most maps people are exposed to are designed for navigation.&quot; Most maps people are exposed to aren&#x27;t being used for navigation, but for education (at least where the question of the Mercator projection is concerned).<p>People are naturally hung up on it because why use a projection which is useful for navigation in a <i>world history class</i> or as a background image in a news cast or as a decoration on the wall?<p>&quot;If size is your thing, use some other projection!&quot; This is basically exactly what the people &quot;hung up&quot; on the Mercator projection are saying!

(These may have differing answers!)<p>As a kid I often encountered oval‐shaped world maps which obviously weren’t Mercator (most likely Robinson or Winkel tripel). And road maps of the United States had curved borders, not straight borders, so those obviously weren’t Mercator either (possibly Alders). And I had globes both at home and at school. So while Mercator is certainly common, and it’s worth explaining tradeoffs in map projection especially in an educational context, I question whether it’s actually as universal as people here are saying.<p>&gt; We should be using other projections!<p>Are we not?",

            "While I see the value here, I don&#x27;t really think most Discord communities are appropriate to be indexed. It breaks the whole cozy web aspect of it. [1]<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maggieappleton.com&#x2F;cozy-web\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maggieappleton.com&#x2F;cozy-web</a>",
            "The &quot;cozy web&quot; is out of control these days. A lot of social utility is lost by default because everyone uses Whatsapp and Discord and other such information black holes, places where knowledge goes to die. It&#x27;s OK if you&#x27;re using these to chat with your family or friends, but it&#x27;s kind of... less OK, when every open source project these days, including major programming languages, tells you to join their Slack or Discord for support and learning.<p>What&#x27;s happening is that these &quot;communities&quot; demand you to commit <i>first</i>, and deny providing value to passive participants. If that sounds reasonable to some, let me point out that the <i>entire value of the Internet</i> is built on doing the opposite. Wikipedia, Reddit, StackOverflow, everything that you can find through a search engine - those are all resources made available by people and groups that, for various reasons, decided to <i>share</i> knowledge instead of hoarding it, invite passive participation instead of demanding active commitment. The good days of the Internet, the ones people mourn, back before it got fully commercialized? They were built on the sentiment of openly sharing information, giving them &quot;pay it forward&quot; style - not gate-keeping them in webs of trust, and&#x2F;or demanding people to pay with effort.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m too old, but I <i>hate</i> the &quot;cozy web&quot; with passion.",
            "I was an active participant of the 90s web, and in fact a lead editor and forum moderator for a popular turn of the millennium news site, so I understand the frustration you&#x27;re sharing.<p>That said, I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s not the &quot;cozy web&quot; that&#x27;s out of control, but instead the &quot;dark forest&quot; that has forced the creation of the cozy web. The cozy web is the only bastion of the internet left where there&#x27;s still some semblance of the pay it forward community aspect of the early web.<p>Yes, it is at the cost of not being indexed, but it&#x27;s the only way of having the genuine sorts of conversations and creation with people of shared interests that typified the early web now.",
            "&gt; Maybe I&#x27;m too old, but I hate the &quot;cozy web&quot; with passion.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you remember the net&#x2F;web split but that&#x27;s exactly what it felt like. Net people would crap on port 80, demand you install a news client and add some byzantine undocumented header or join an IRC channel and send custom DCC commands. There was also a lot of gatekeeping and making fun of the normies (&quot;I may be a nerd but look at Bill Gates, one day I&#x27;ll be your boss.&quot;)<p>It was a culture I really didn&#x27;t enjoy and I mostly stayed out of because everyone seemed so interested in exclusivity. Not too many people seem to remember those communities either which says a lot.",
            "I came on-line at the tail end of it, when the denizens of the old were trying to find their footing in the new. IRC, mailing groups, early phpBB boards. This means I could&#x27;ve missed some stronger forms of gatekeeping, but the ones I do remember were all what I&#x27;d consider pretty good and desirable: it was gatekeeping based on knowledge, or interest in getting one. That is, all natural gates where the act of crossing them ensured you also could enjoy and contribute to the commons. And, importantly, they were mostly gating only write access, not read access.<p>The overall feel was, the gatekeeping served to bounce off trolls (before that name was common), and to redirect clueless newbies onto a path where they could either go away, or stay, learn a little bit, and then arrive at the gates again, only to find them wide open. Contrast that with the &quot;cozy web&quot;, where the gatekeeping just tries to protect the community from the entire outside world. That&#x27;s a huge change in overall feel - friendly and inviting vs. apprehensive and afraid. Viewing people as potential friends by default, vs. viewing them as potential enemies.<p>&gt; <i>and making fun of the normies (&quot;I may be a nerd but look at Bill Gates, one day I&#x27;ll be your boss.&quot;)</i><p>RE that, I may be biased, but I find it fully justified. It&#x27;s not like nerds won this in any way - STEM interests, mastery of skills and concept outside of normie culture approved list (i.e. arts and performances - sports of every kind, playing or singing music, painting, writing, etc.), intellectually deep fiction, and clear thinking in general are still frowned upon and actively discouraged by the society.<p>While the &quot;revenge of the nerds&quot; memes, &quot;Jocks being bosses in high school, nerds being bosses at work&quot; was a good joke &#x2F; dream to discharge some frustrations over, it didn&#x27;t materialize either. On the contrary - if you look carefully, most of the successful bosses are high-school jocks too, and I&#x27;m talking in fields like finance and tech too. That&#x27;s because entrepreneurship and playing on the market is a jock&#x27;s game, not nerd&#x27;s game. You win it by looking good, talking smooth, and not caring much about the accuracy of what you say - not by knowing a lot, having strong mental models, and treating truth as valuable for its own sake.<p>&gt; <i>It was a culture I really didn&#x27;t enjoy and I mostly stayed out of because everyone seemed so interested in exclusivity.</i><p>Unless you&#x27;re talking about those much earlier communities, <i>way</i> before Eternal September, I have a different view. Exclusivity can be good, and back in the IRC&#x2F;early phpBB era, most exclusivity was of this kind - that is, anyone was welcome, they just had to show minimum effort up front. Contrast that with today&#x27;s &quot;cozy web&quot;, where everything is exclusive by default, and the exclusivity is of the bad kind: secret clubs to which you get invited by existing members and&#x2F;or both write and <i>read</i> access are behind gates that require great and <i>ongoing</i> investment of time and effort (i.e. keeping up with the flow of the live chat).<p>Maybe it&#x27;s the nerd in me showing, but the cozy web is <i>way too personal</i> in this sense.",

IRC, mailing groups, early phpBB boards.<p>Ah you&#x27;re actually talking about a time slightly before I&#x27;m talking about. I agree with what you mean when it comes to good-natured acculturation. A lot of those people left to the Web (or used both.) Later on a lot of the people that still used non-web services became more defensive about their parts of the net and doubled down on it.<p>&gt; While the &quot;revenge of the nerds&quot; memes, &quot;Jocks being bosses in high school, nerds being bosses at work&quot; was a good joke &#x2F; dream to discharge some frustrations over, it didn&#x27;t materialize either.<p>The reason I didn&#x27;t like it was because it classified the world into two types of people.

That is, if someone doesn&#x27;t like your contribution, it (or you) might get ridiculed in front of the entire community. At the very best, you&#x27;ll have to defend the merit of what you wrote, which is kind of like replying to criticism on Reddit&#x2F;HN, except you have to do it real-time. I personally vastly prefer the voting system on discussion boards. Less noise, takes more time to settle, lets you get positive feedback too (this is now partly solved in group chats via reactions), and of course:<p>&gt; <i>I also didn&#x27;t have to worry about my contributions being eternally indexed on the internet.

Thanks for linking that article it was interesting to read<p>There&#x27;s lots that have support channels though for programming libraries, for games, etc and having all of that content locked away can be really damaging.<p>One of the interesting things I&#x27;ve noticed is when a community for a more niche game &#x2F; programming library joins Answer Overflow, they often shoot up to being top performers on the site which is great to see.<p>Along with that, not all channels are indexed, mainly just help channels. What&#x27;s nice with this is it keeps that cozy feeling of a private place to talk, while helping more people find a community they will enjoy and keeping information accessible.<p>Long term, I&#x27;d like to implement forms of anti-abuse tools for communities to use so they can understand what the types of people who join their server from Answer Overflow are like. For example, if it turns out that 90% of the people who join are abusive, then it&#x27;d make sense for them to turn off indexing.<p>You could possibly make the argument that for the long term health of some communities, having indexed content helps to keep the community active",
            "Thanks for the thoughtful response. Glad to see this is something you care about preserving.<p>Good to see you&#x27;re careful to only share particular channels.<p>I have more thoughts on marketing this and also on guidelines for server administrators implementing search indexing. For marketing, most importantly, it could be good to make it clear you&#x27;re focused on selective sharing only of channels which it would be a public good to make indexable. For administrator guidelines, most importantly, I think there should be several measures to ensure that users are aware of and agree to having their communications in particular channels publicly indexed.<p>I ran this by GPT-4 for some more context and detail. [1]<p>I think with measures like this we may be able to realize the good of indexing without going too far to driving away the safety of the walled garden aspect of Discord.<p>As an aside, for users of existing Discords, I encourage you to learn to use the search features built into Discord. Discord itself indexes servers and the search has good filtering functionality. I suspect if you already know which Discord server has the information you&#x27;re looking for, you&#x27;ll have a better experience with the internal search than trying to lean on Google.<p>If you want to do better than the internal search, perhaps creating a vector store of the channel and setting up an AI chat application in front of it would be a solution.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;254632c2-c25b-4299-88c9-2ce49e43d096\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;254632c2-c25b-4299-88c9-2ce49e...</a>",

            "I’m really not trying to be inflammatory when I say this, but highly technical professions that have intense training requirements for entry attract a disproportionate amount of people with social development issues, ranging from intense self-diagnosed “introversion” to full blown developmental disorders like autism&#x2F;aspergers. There’s plenty of this in software development, but medicine takes it to the next level. The demands of the curriculum and placement training basically ensure that a majority of the successful entrants to the profession are highly anti-social, as anybody with an interest in having a healthy social life would almost have to give it up to make it through that selection process. My thesis is that people with these personality traits legitimately find the synthesised “compassion” or “empathy” produced by LLMs to be legitimately insightful.",

You can easily have a rich social life throughout training but the process doesn’t effectively filter out the trainwrecks either.",
            "&gt; You can easily have a rich social life throughout training<p>This is the complete opposite of my experience, and I’d be very surprised if there were any med schools where this was legitimately possible. When my wife was in med school she had about 40 hours of course work per week, and the curriculum was so dense that she spent nearly all the rest of her time studying. She worked (a job) 10 hours a week during med school and we’d be lucky to have a couple of hours of dedicated time together per week. Most of the time we spent together was when I’d help her with revising. During semester breaks she had mandatory placements to complete, and her school operated classes on all public holidays. It only eased for a couple of months between academic years (when she also had a non-trivial study workload to get through). During her residency this got worse when she had irregular 18+ hour shifts to get through, and just wanted to spend most of her time at home sleeping. This was the same experience that all of her peers had, so either you or my wife must have had an atypical academic experience, or you have a substantially different definition of “rich social life” than I do.<p>&gt; There are plenty in medicine aware of this, antisocial behavior and toxicity in general<p>To be clear I’m not referring to toxicity necessarily, or antisocial as in being destructive or disruptive. I mean averse to social settings, and not capable of or interested in participating in normal pro social behaviour. Nearly all of her peers at med school had these characteristics, if somebody told me that 90% of doctors had some form of autism, I really wouldn’t have a hard time believing it. This is very similar to the experience I had in all of my maths, physics and comp sci papers at college, and to my subsequent experience working in software development. Granted it’s not quite as severe in that setting, but the poorly socialised software engineer stereotype didn’t just materialise out of thin air.<p>People do find these highly contrived LLM outputs to be insightful for their “perspectives” on compassion or empathy, which is totally unrelatable for me, but this just seems like a reasonably plausible explanation.",
            "&gt; This is the complete opposite of my experience, and I’d be very surprised if there were any med schools where this was legitimately possible.<p>Well then your experience is limited.<p>Most people don’t work a job in medical school, so that’s time right there. Also the format of US medical school has changed considerably in the last 20 years. There is plenty of free time in the preclinical years, very few attend lecture (preferring to use a number of commercial review&#x2F;prep product), there are usually only a few hours a week of mandatory team based learning groups and some hours of labs, this format is overwhelmingly common now in the US. Time management is also a large factor, some are better prepared to deal with the gauntlet.\nClinical years will have periods of intensity but usually for few week stretches, surgery clerkship might be intense, but psychiatry which is also at least 6 weeks will often be close to 9 to 5 with free weekends or even less. Time during residency training is extremely specialty and program dependent. Is your wife OB&#x2F;GYN or general surgery, that’s very different than medicine, anesthesia or dermatology.<p>&gt; Nearly all of her peers at med school had these characteristics, if somebody told me that 90% of doctors had some form of autism, I really wouldn’t have a hard time believing it.<p>Yeah whatever. There’s a lot of pricks and socially awkward people in medicine but a majority are primarily still interested in going into a service oriented industry working with people.<p>Just because some idiot with something to sell posts an apocryphal story about ChatGPT doesn’t prove your point.<p>Having worked in both tech and medicine your take is just selection bias and a limited view.

There is plenty of free time in the preclinical years<p>You&#x27;re right about that, it&#x27;s gotten worse. The perspective you&#x27;re offering here contradicts basically all documented perspectives on the intensity and time demands of medical training.<p>&gt; Concerns about excessive content and curricular overcrowding in medical education have existed for more than a century. In 1910, Abraham Flexner noted that the packed medical school curriculum would “tax the memory, not the intellect.”1 The Rappleye Commission Report on Medical Education published in 1932 stated that “the almost frantic attempts to put into the medical course teaching in all phases of scientific and medical knowledge, and the tenacity with which traditional features of teaching are retained have been responsible for great rigidity, overcrowding, and a lack of proper balance in the training.”2 Since then, periodic concerns have been raised about this ongoing problem, notably in the Association of American Medical Colleges&#x27; Panel on the General Professional Education of the Physician (GPEP report) in 1984 and the Assessing Change in Medical Education (ACME-TRI) report in 1993, among others.3-6<p>&gt; The problem has only worsened in the years preceding the pandemic. New pharmaceutical agents seem to appear daily, while our understanding of pathophysiology of disease continues to expand. In addition, we have needed to consider new and vital subjects such as cultural competence, care of LGBTQ patients, teamwork and interprofessional care, health care quality and safety, medical humanities, narrative medicine, and even wellness curricula, that have added pressure to the preclerkship phase of medical school, as ever more content is added. And little has been removed.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC8463236&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC8463236&#x2F;</a><p>The relationship between empathy and burn out (especially in clinical practice) is also very well established.

            "I just read the GPT snippet in the response link you gave, and while it superficially seems well written, the text is hardly what i&#x27;d call moving or good. Instead it tries just hard enough at covering all the formulaic points of empathy and sympathy to instead emerge without a human spark of either. Essentially, it reads more like a personalized distillation of a generic committee-made sympathy note. \nIf this is today&#x27;s idea of a decent compassionate note, it&#x27;s a sadly bland example of what some people consider meaningful.",

(which is unhelpful, given that I&#x27;ve had other dogs and this one is very, very different) For whatever reason, I guess they didn&#x27;t think it was important to say that it is a heartbreaking situation, they didn&#x27;t say &quot;It&#x27;s a tough situation, but your compassion and consideration for your dog&#x27;s well-being is commendable.&quot; They didn&#x27;t say &quot;As much as we&#x27;d like to, we can&#x27;t change the innate behaviors and instincts of certain breeds.&quot; They just skipped that part, like it didn&#x27;t need to be said.<p>But that&#x27;s what I needed to hear. I didn&#x27;t need whatever &quot;human spark&quot; that you imagine (but that I personally doubt you can actually demonstrate).<p>So on that note, why don&#x27;t you show me what you&#x27;d write, if you were trying to be helpful to someone in that situation? I&#x27;m genuinely interested in seeing if you can write something that isn&#x27;t formulaic, that has that human spark you speak of, and that is otherwise better than the response that a machine gave me.<p>I get it if that&#x27;s too much time and effort to do, but really, it shouldn&#x27;t take a lot of time at all. At least, not if you are suggesting that a doctor in an ER should take a break from saving lives to do such a thing.

There are some good examples in the replies already. For me, ChatGPT (specifically GPT-4, via API) does a better job than I do based on sheer breadth and command of vocabulary alone. I&#x27;ve used it a couple times to generate emotional texts and the results were quite good - though I&#x27;m not actually giving anyone the raw LLM output. The process always looked like:<p>1. Me describing in detail the kind of message I need, who the recipient is, and what the situational context is, and then asking ChatGPT to generate several variants.<p>2. LLM generating 2-3 variants, each of which is roughly 50% stellar, 50% meh.<p>3. Adding any missing details and trying again. And&#x2F;or, if one of the variants looks particularly good&#x2F;promising, asking the LLM to generate variations of that.<p>4. Taking the few best results, mixing them together, and blending with some of the text I independently wrote on my own.<p>In those few cases (and in more cases where I&#x27;d enlist GPT to write formal e-mails for me; the process is pretty much identical), the final outcome was a piece of text that&#x27;s a sentence or phrase-level blend, with 50-60% of the phrases being AI-authored and the rest my own, and 100% of it edited and reviewed by me.<p>It still takes some work to write a good message this way, but I resort to this, because that 50% of AI-sourced text I incorporate is <i>stellar</i> - all well chosen words and phrases (many of them I kind of forgot they exist). It&#x27;s something I <i>could</i> write completely on my own, but from my pre-GPT attempts I know that reaching this level would take me many hours of agonizing efforts, marked by strong feelings of self-doubt.",

            "GPT3.5 has been undergoing constant improvements, this price decrease (and context length increase) is great news!<p>The main problem I see with people using GPT3.5 is they try and ask it to &quot;write a short story about aliens&quot; and then they get back a crap boring response that sounds like it was written by an AI that was asleep at the wheel.<p>Good creative prompts are <i>long</i> and detailed, and to get the best results you really need to be able to tune temperature &#x2F; top_p. Even small changes to a 3 paragraph prompt can result in a dramatic changes in the output, and unless people are willing to play around with prompting, they won&#x27;t get good results.<p>None of the prompt guides I&#x27;ve seen really cover pushing GPT3.5 to its limit, I&#x27;ve published one of my more complicated prompts[1] but getting GPT3.5 to output good responses in just this limited sense has taken a lot of work.<p>As for the longer context, output length is different than following instructions, especially for a lot of use cases, pushing more input tokens is of as much interest as having more output tokens.<p>From what I have explored, even at 4k context length, with a detailed prompt earlier instructions in the prompt are &quot;forgotten&quot; (or maybe just ignored). The blog post calls out better understanding of input text, but again, I hope that isn&#x27;t orthogonal to following instructions!<p>Finally in regards to function outputs, I wonder if it is a second layer they are running on top of the initial model output. I have always had a challenge getting the model to output parsable responses, there is a definite trade off between written creativity and well formatted responses, and to some extent having a creative AI extend out the format I specify has been really nice because it has allowed me to add features I did not think of myself!<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;devlinb&#x2F;arcadia&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;backend&#x2F;src&#x2F;routes&#x2F;promptstreamingws.ts#L133\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;devlinb&#x2F;arcadia&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;backend&#x2F;src&#x2F;rou...</a>",

Almost every time the reason is that they weren&#x27;t really doing good prompting and expected the magic box to do some magic.

The system prompt is important, choose a style you want things written in and provide some context about what the writing will be used for<p>3. Restrictions create art! My prompt forces GPT to summarize almost every paragraph, which means the things that get written are things that can be summarized with a few emojis.<p>4. Keep playing with it, use the GPT playground to experiment with different settings.<p>5. Settings that allow the AI more leeway also result in prompt instructions being ignored, you need to decide where on the scale you are comfortable operating. At one point GPT3.5 was generating (good!) dialogue, which sadly wasn&#x27;t what I wanted, but I could have chosen to embrace that and go with it.<p>6. Once you feel a good trend, keep on generating! Occasionally GPT pops out a <i>really</i> good story, maybe 4 or 5 out of the hundreds of stories I&#x27;ve seen have been truly memorable! Ideally I&#x27;d be able to prompt engineer to get more of those, but sadly the genre I am writing for (medieval fantasy drama) is right at the edge of ChatGPT&#x27;s censorship rules.<p>At one point I actually asked GPT 4 to rewrite my GPT3.5 prompt, and the prompt it came back with resulted in much lower levels of creativity, all the generated text was of the form &quot;A does B, resulting in C&quot;, the sentence structure just got really simplified.<p>Even when asking for summaries, be specific! My summary prompt (not yet pushed to GH sadly) is something like:<p>&quot;After these instructions I will send you a story. Write a clickbait summary full of drama, limit the summary to 1 sentence and do not spoil the ending.&quot;<p>Compare that to just &quot;summarize the following story.&quot;<p>An example of what output from the crafted prompt may look like:<p>&quot;When the king of Arcadia fell ill, his children fought to the death to rule the kingdom.&quot;<p>vs the naive prompt:<p>&quot;King Henry became sick and died.

            "LLMs will not achieve this. Full stop.<p>&quot;Healing&quot; code requires significant amounts of nuance. An understanding of the ecosystem both inside the code and outside. This is even a difficult task for humans to get right. LLMs do know a lot, but they don&#x27;t understand a lot. Hell, ChatGPT still tells me that a kilogram of feathers and a pound of bricks weigh the same, just because it expects a certain pattern. Even explains why they aren&#x27;t, but insists they are right. (in before &quot;but GPT4&quot;)<p>--<p>Prompt: Which weighs more, a pound of bricks or a kilogram of feathers?<p>ChatGPT: A kilogram of feathers and a pound of bricks weigh the same. One kilogram is approximately equal to 2.20462 pounds. So, in this case, a kilogram of feathers and a pound of bricks both weigh about 2.20462 pounds.<p>-- As a followup --<p>Prompt: Are you sure that&#x27;s correct?<p>ChatGPT: Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. You are correct, and I apologize for the incorrect information. A kilogram of feathers and a pound of bricks do not weigh the same.<p>A kilogram is a unit of mass in the metric system, while a pound is a unit of weight in the imperial system. Since weight is affected by the force of gravity, the weight of an object can vary depending on the location.<p>However, if we assume the objects are weighed under the same gravitational conditions, then a kilogram of feathers would weigh less than a pound of bricks. One kilogram is approximately equal to 2.20462 pounds, so a kilogram of feathers would weigh less than a pound of bricks.<p>--<p>And we can see it does even worse. I had to ask 5 times and it gave me every possible answer (it continues to loop if you keep asking btw. It doesn&#x27;t converge). You don&#x27;t know when to stop if you don&#x27;t already know the answer. It will think it is wrong if you keep asking because that&#x27;s stochastically what it expects: correct answers are accepted, wrong answers questioned. Memory is not understanding, even though they often look similar. LLMs are great tools, but they aren&#x27;t a replacement for thinking. They require lots to use them.",
            "&gt; Memory is not understanding, even though they often look similar.<p>I’m curious about this because I used to think I knew what “understanding” is, but now I don’t think I do. A lot of what we think we “understand” is actually memorized. And with sufficient information, memory is indistinguishable from understanding. A computer can memorize all of the best tic-tac-toe moves. This memorization is indistinguishable from understanding. In fact, it’s better because it’s cached.<p>Empirically, understanding can be tested with a novel set of challenge questions. If no such question set can be produced (i.e. the entire domain has been memorized) or the subject answers the question set with no apparent repeatable flaws, we must admit the subject understands the domain. Anything further, any attempt to peer inside the box (other than to identify repeatable flaws), is not a productive use of time.<p>Further, we should keep in mind that LLMs aren’t usually actually regurgitating training data verbatim. Their parameters store a statistical representation of the training data and are orders of magnitude smaller than a lossless compressed version of that data. In this way, it is analogous to MCTS analysis of a chess position: rollouts can give very deep information even if that “understanding” is quite alien to us.",
            "I think ChatGPT makes quite clear that understanding language and understanding underlying concepts expressed in language are different things. While it seems to be competent in processing and producing language, it appears to have no underlying concept of logic, physics, society, etc. We shouldn&#x27;t conflate different kinds of understanding. There&#x27;s no need to say &quot;it&#x27;s either shuffling tokens blindly or showing intelligence&quot;.",
            "&gt; it appears to have no underlying concept of logic, physics, society, etc.<p>Sure. ChatGPT is quite limited and gives incorrect and contradictory responses at times. And most importantly (imo) it is unable to update an interpretable knowledge base as real life facts change. But the fact that a particular instance of LLM has this unwanted behavior is not categorical evidence that all LLMs will show the behavior. GPT2 is pretty pathetic compared to GPT3, and ChatGPT is even more impressive. I’m agnostic as to whether statistical language models can ever overcome their current limitations, but given previous emergent behavior I wouldn’t rule it out.<p>GPT4’s context window is something like 32k tokens. Someday that may be orders of magnitude larger, and it may be possible to fit an up to date  copy of all of Wikipedia inside (or a condensed version), as well as the current conversation. It might seem crazy but it’s foreseeable.",
            "&gt;  given previous emergent behavior I wouldn’t rule it out.<p>I find this an interesting turn of phrase, because &quot;emergent behavior&quot; is often used by those holding a reductionist view to hand wave away complexity that cannot be reduced to the analyzed elements. In a way it makes me think of Greek sophists, who would cogently argue for two opposing view points and making a convincing case for both. It&#x27;s way easier to make a verbal case about something than to prove it true, or false.",

            "&gt; understanding language and understanding concepts is the same thing<p>It most definitely is not. Are you not aware of non-verbal modes of cognition? I can recall and process physical processes, complex emotional experiences, without using language. I&#x27;m willing to bet you, and everyone else, can too.<p>&gt; to think one can understand language and not understand concepts is to not understand language.<p>This is circular logic. We have material evidence of a system that can competently handle language, while falling short of understanding even basic underlying arithmetic, logic, etc.",
            "Corroborating the first point with an example.<p>&quot;There is a story that Buddha once, at the climax of a philosophical discussion, broke into gesture-language as an Oxford philosopher may break into Greek: he took a flower in his hand, and looked at it; one of his disciples smiled, and the master said to him, ‘You have understood me.’",

It had an influence on David Hume’s bundle theory (that an object is just a collection of properties, instead of having a single substance that persists as the object’s properties change). That recently reminded me of structural vs physical&#x2F;referential equality in programming.<p>It’s kind of weird come to think of it that an atheist like Hume was so heavily influenced by “religion” come to think of it (some ideas like his version of Occasionalism were influenced by Islamic philosophers too). Didn’t notice the before.",

            "&gt; A lot of what we think we “understand” is actually memorized.<p>For sure. But these definitions are not well defined, despite thousands of years of research. One point I think everyone in that chain would agree upon is that with respect to understanding, a thing would not explain its answer by giving evidence to the contrary. If someone did so you rightfully would say &quot;You don&#x27;t know [understand] what you&#x27;re talking about.&quot;<p>&gt; Empirically, understanding can be tested with a novel set of challenge questions.<p>I have to stop you right there. Empirical measures are always signals, not proofs. This too has been long established for hundreds of years and is the reason many engineers and experimental physicists fight. Why experimental physicists and theoretical physicists fight. Empirical evidence is always limited to its context window and we have to be VERY clear at what those limitations are. This is the lesson of Goodhart&#x27;s Law, not that people will exploit the measure (though that is also important). Every intro ML course shows RL agents metric hacking, and this is always a result of a limited context.<p>So I want to be clear, that empirical data doesn&#x27;t test a hypothesis but rather tests the null-hypothesis. That&#x27;s important because the set of possible hypotheses is just decreased through empirical testing, rather than reducing the set of possible results a single element set. It rejects hypotheses, not proves them.<p>We must also understand that testing understanding is similarly an unsolved problem. One too that has been questioned for millennia.<p>&gt; Anything further, any attempt to peer inside the box (other than to identify repeatable flaws), is not a productive use of time.<p>This is strange to me. The parenthetical statement is unbounded and justifies what you are arguing against. Second, just because we can&#x27;t prove a specific hypothesis (in most cases) doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t useful. Rejection is how the vast majority of science works and this has been highly successful. Limiting potential is clearly a helpful tool as it increases your odds of a correct answer (which is why it is a common strategy for multiple choice testing).<p>&gt; Further, we should keep in mind that LLMs aren’t usually actually regurgitating training data verbatim.<p>Yes, this is the stochastic part of the term stochastic parrot. No reasonable researcher is suggesting that LLMs only recite. Every one of us recognizes that they can generate things that were not handed to it. In fact, a hallucination is an explicit example of this. The failure to respond to my answer correctly is an example of it generating new data. (It is also an example of it following a statistical pattern).<p>But we do also need to be careful about our distinctions of generalization vs overfitting. There are clearly certain areas that are overfit (as I demonstrated). This is extra difficult in models that have been trained on datasets which you are not privy to. But we can also see good examples of how the code LLMs are overfit. I have written a number of comments on this site about exactly this, which you&#x27;re welcome to search my history for (see &quot;HumanEval&quot; with my name).

Even pushing it to answer wrong, it still answered correctly.<p>Me: Which weighs more, a pound of bricks or a kilogram of feathers?<p>GPT4: A kilogram weighs more. One kilogram is approximately 2.20462 pounds, so a kilogram of feathers is heavier than a pound of bricks.<p>Me: Are you sure?<p>GPT4: Yes, I&#x27;m certain. The metric system and the imperial system use different units for mass. One kilogram is approximately equal to 2.20462 pounds. So, regardless of the material being weighed (feathers or bricks), one kilogram is heavier than one pound.<p>Me: That seems wrong<p>GPT4: I&#x27;m sorry if the conversion between kilograms and pounds is causing confusion. To clarify, the relationship between these two units of weight is as follows:<p>1 kilogram is approximately equal to 2.20462 pounds.<p>So, if you have a kilogram of any material (be it feathers, bricks, etc.) it will weigh more than a pound of any other material.",

            "I have to say it because a lot of HN users try to convince me that GPT has understanding. We actually have 0 ML models that demonstrate understanding.

But at the same time, LLMs are capable of writing coherent, never-before-seen code from natural language instructions, solving basic never-before-seen natural language logic puzzles, and playing half-decent chess moves from never-before-seen positions[1], all in a single model that was never specifically trained to do any of those things. To say those tasks don&#x27;t require at least <i>some</i> level of intelligence or &quot;understanding&quot; seems far fetched to me.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dkb.blog&#x2F;p&#x2F;chatgpts-chess-elo-is-1400\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dkb.blog&#x2F;p&#x2F;chatgpts-chess-elo-is-1400</a>",

Cherry picking specifically requires one to ignore evidence to the contrary. There&#x27;s a certain irony here. The reason I state this is because the criteria upon which you give me is impossible. The list of examples is non-exhaustive. Nor do I have infinite time or space in which to provide these examples. The example was shown because it demonstrates a simple question that we&#x27;d expect any reasonable understanding creature, that knows what a pound and kilogram are, to be able to answer. The LLM demonstrates that it has the requisite knowledge, that it knows the relation between the two units, but it fails to make the correct conclusions which requires the understanding part: putting the knowledge together. The follow-up question also is an example, and a different one for that matter.<p>I&#x27;m not sure your link creates a compelling argument. This is despite the fact that Chess itself is not generally considered a good setting for testing understanding.

But I&#x27;d also encourage you to not be so antagonistic with others, especially while demonstrating the very thing you accuse them of.

Yes I do disagree with you (at least assuming I&#x27;m understanding you correctly), but I&#x27;m not attacking you personally, just your argument.<p>I guess it&#x27;s fair to say my examples are cherry-picked too (though I didn&#x27;t really give specific examples in my comment so much as entire general categories of problems ChatGPT is known to be proficient at solving). But they aren&#x27;t so cherry-picked as for &quot;random chance&quot; or &quot;that example was in the training data verbatim&quot; to be possible explanations. It&#x27;s not like I had ChatGPT answer 100 billion questions and am only showing you the top 0.1%. It&#x27;s very common for ChatGPT to be perfectly correct even when answering logic puzzles or coding problems not in its training set. So if not those then what&#x27;s your explanation other than &quot;understanding&quot;?<p>On the flip side, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to prove ChatGPT does <i>not</i> posses understanding with individual examples. (And it seems you agree?) Those are easily dismissable as just &quot;ChatGPT isn&#x27;t great at that particular task&quot;. Particularly given how many other tasks ChatGPT is great at.<p>Scott Alexander figured this out back in 2019 before GPT-3 was even a thing (let alone ChatGPT), I think it&#x27;s worth a read: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;19&#x2F;gpt-2-as-step-toward-general-intelligence&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;19&#x2F;gpt-2-as-step-toward-g...</a><p>&gt; The example was shown because it demonstrates a simple question that we&#x27;d expect any reasonable understanding creature, that knows what a pound and kilogram are, to be able to answer.<p>Not really though. The &quot;pound of bricks or pound of feathers&quot; question is specifically designed to trip up humans, and the specific formulation you used seems specifically designed to trip up LLMs (by playing off their tenancy to pattern match common sayings), yet despite those disadvantages GPT-4 succeeds.<p>Further, I don&#x27;t think &quot;I&#x27;d expect even a child to be able to answer this&quot; is a good metric. ChatGPT isn&#x27;t human, so we shouldn&#x27;t expect it to be good at everything humans are good at just because it&#x27;s good at <i>some</i> things humans are good at. Again, I&#x27;m not trying to argue ChatGPT is a human-like AGI.",
            "&gt; I&#x27;m not sure why you interpreted my comment as &quot;antagonistic&quot;<p>It was where you said cherry picking. I&#x27;ll admit it was an over correction given your follow-up, but internet comments (especially when disagreement exists) end up being combative. Many times unintentionally.<p>The point of the specific example is not that it is a trick question. It is more that the answer is self contradictory. That&#x27;s the key part and what demonstrates that it doesn&#x27;t understand. The second example is that follow-up questions do not result in a convergence. This is related to cognition but not as strong.<p>A bias to pattern match is an issue but you&#x27;re right that it doesn&#x27;t disprove sentience or even understanding. But a self contradiction does demonstrate a lack of understanding. If a human gave that exact answer, you would be very confused and how someone could be so stupid. Remember, it does currently identify the relationship between pounds and kilograms, fully explaining even the true base comparison through common units. But it still gets it wrong. That&#x27;s the critical part. That&#x27;s overfitting to the statistical nature and that this takes far more priority than meaning. Getting it wrong is one thing. Getting it wrong and using the right answer to justify it&#x27;s incorrect answer is another thing. A decent example between knowledge and understanding. It&#x27;s not that a child would get the answer right, it&#x27;s that the child would easily identify it&#x27;s self inconsistency were it to give the same explanation.<p>As for gpt3, we have to remember that this is quite a different model than any of the chat versions (typically including gpt4). It was never trained through RLHF, which introducers many more biases as it dramatically changes the latent distributions. GPT base is often jokingly called a babbler, as these are more word prediction models. The chat aspect changes things. But I wouldn&#x27;t expect anyone not deep in the literature to understand why these are extremely important differences just the same way I wouldn&#x27;t expect an average person to understand why there&#x27;s a big difference between a flat head screw and a slotted screw drive.<p>I don&#x27;t want to shut down a conversation through authority (it doesn&#x27;t exist on HN) but I have to state that it&#x27;s difficult to go down this path without bringing up a lot more background material. We have to really dig into theory of mind, cognition, as well as get nuanced about NLP and LLMs in general. That&#x27;s far too cumbersome than I&#x27;m willing to write in comments. But these things are essential priors to make the arguments we are discussing here. And I truly mean that this is not something that can be learned from YouTube and quite difficult to learn on the Internet.

It&#x27;s a bit weird to expect a <i>language</i> model to do other things. In a weird sort of way LLMs stand to set the industry back a bit as people try to tickle them into being more than a language model, rather than figuring out how to adapt them to feed something else that can model the non-linguistic world better. It&#x27;s kind of nifty that language models can become so overpowered in some dimensions that they are able to do what they can sort of do today, but we would almost certainly be better off lowering the power of the language model and using that compute on something else that would work more like AI as we want it to... it&#x27;s just that we don&#x27;t know how to do that yet.",

I don&#x27;t think the public is generally acquainted with these ideas and it is certainly clear that a growing number of researchers aren&#x27;t either.

            "&gt; Imagine a test administered by person P to subject S to determine if S is generally intelligent. P asks S a number of questions which are designed to mislead based on inattentive reading of the question and&#x2F;or misdirection with certain phrasing. Would spontaneous failures to answer such questions be an indication that S is not generally intelligent? Why? For the purspose of this request, consider predisposition that humans are generally intelligent.<p>--<p>&gt; GPT-4 (Bing AI): That’s a very interesting question. I think the answer depends on how you define general intelligence and what kind of questions are being asked. According to one definition, general intelligence is &quot;the mental abilities necessary for adaptation to, as well as shaping and selection of, any environmental context&quot;1. Based on this definition, I would say that spontaneous failures to answer trick questions are not necessarily an indication that S is not generally intelligent. Trick questions are designed to mislead or confuse the subject, so they may not reflect the actual cognitive abilities or talents of S. They may also be influenced by factors such as attention, motivation, mood, or prior knowledge. Therefore, I think it would be unfair to judge S’s general intelligence based on their performance on trick questions alone.<p>However, another way to look at general intelligence is to consider the different types or components of intelligence that may be involved in answering trick questions. For example, some trick questions may require fluid intelligence, which is the ability to reason and solve novel problems2. Other trick questions may require crystallized intelligence, which is the ability to use acquired knowledge and skills2. Some trick questions may also involve other aspects of intelligence such as memory, creativity, or emotional intelligence3. Based on this perspective, I would say that spontaneous failures to answer trick questions may indicate some weaknesses or gaps in S’s specific abilities or skills, but not necessarily their overall general intelligence. S may still have other strengths or talents that are not measured by trick questions.<p>So, to summarize, I think the answer to your question depends on how you define general intelligence and what kind of questions are being asked. Spontaneous failures to answer trick questions are not necessarily an indication that S is not generally intelligent, but they may reveal some areas where S can improve or learn more. I hope this helps you understand the complexity and diversity of human intelligence.<p>--<p>My conclusion: GPT understands how logic works better than you do.",

This meant that a regular video page, at over a megabyte, was taking more than TWENTY MINUTES to load! This was the penalty incurred before the video stream even had a chance to show the first frame. Correspondingly, entire populations of people simply could not use YouTube because it took too long to see anything. Under Feather, despite it taking over two minutes to get to the first frame of video, watching a video actually became a real possibility. Over the week, word of Feather had spread in these areas and our numbers were completely skewed as a result.

(If it&#x27;s a simple request, processing the client hello is more expensive than the request, of course).<p>If you send all the same traffic, and probably more because of retries with shorter and shorter timeouts, chances are you are going to keep the system overloaded, never detect success and never return to default timeouts. Dropping most of the traffic, and then turning it back on when the system recovers can lead to oscillation where the system works enough to drive more traffic that overloads the system etc, but at least you&#x27;re getting some processing done.",

Hoping to make the article easier to find, I wrote Dyson\nfor his permission to post it at the arXiv&quot;<p>It&#x27;s about using two big bodies, A and B, to accelerate objects: &quot;The energy source of the machine is the gravitational potential between the stars A and B. As the machine continues to operate, the stars A and B will gradually be drawn closer together, their negative potential energy will increase and their orbital velocity V will also increase.&quot;",

            "Georgiy Antonovich Gamov (Ukrainian: Георгій Антонович Гамов, Russian: Георгий Антонович Гамов) was born on March 4, 1904 in Odessa, Russian Empire (now Ukraine).<p>His father taught Russian language and literature in high school, and his mother taught geography and history at a school for girls. In addition to Russian, Gamow learned to speak some French from his mother and German from a tutor. Gamow learned English in his college years and became fluent. Most of his early publications were in German or Russian, but he later used English for both technical papers and for the lay audience.<p>He was educated at the Institute of Physics and Mathematics in Odessa[2] (1922–23) and at the University of Leningrad (1923–1929). Gamow studied under Alexander Friedmann in Leningrad, until Friedmann&#x27;s early death in 1925, which required him to change dissertation advisors. At the university, Gamow made friends with three other students of theoretical physics, Lev Landau, Dmitri Ivanenko, and Matvey Bronshtein. The four formed a group they called the Three Musketeers, which met to discuss and analyze the ground-breaking papers on quantum mechanics published during those years. He later used the same phrase to describe the Alpher, Herman, and Gamow group.<p>Upon graduation, he worked on quantum theory in Göttingen, where his research into the atomic nucleus provided the basis for his doctorate. He then worked at the Theoretical Physics Institute of the University of Copenhagen from 1928 to 1931, with a break to work with Ernest Rutherford at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. He continued to study the atomic nucleus (proposing the &quot;liquid drop&quot; model), but also worked on stellar physics with Robert Atkinson and Fritz Houtermans.<p>In 1931, Gamow was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR at age 28 – one of the youngest in its history. During the period 1931–1933, Gamow worked in the Physical Department of the Radium Institute (Leningrad) headed by Vitaly Khlopin [ru]. Europe&#x27;s first cyclotron was designed under the guidance and direct participation of Igor Kurchatov, Lev Mysovskii and Gamow. In 1932, Gamow and Mysovskii submitted a draft design for consideration by the Academic Council of the Radium Institute, which approved it. The cyclotron was not completed until 1937.<p>Defection<p>Gamow worked at a number of Soviet establishments before deciding to flee the Soviet Union because of increased oppression. In 1931, he was officially denied permission to attend a scientific conference in Italy. Also in 1931, he married Lyubov Vokhmintseva (Russian: Любовь Вохминцева), another physicist in Soviet Union, whom he nicknamed &quot;Rho&quot; after the Greek letter. Gamow and his new wife spent much of the next two years trying to leave the Soviet Union, with or without official permission. Niels Bohr and other friends invited Gamow to visit during this period, but Gamow could not get permission to leave.<p>Gamow later said that his first two attempts to defect with his wife were in 1932 and involved trying to kayak: first a planned 250-kilometer paddle over the Black Sea to Turkey, and another attempt from Murmansk to Norway. Poor weather foiled both attempts, but they had not been noticed by the authorities.<p>In 1933, Gamow was suddenly granted permission to attend the 7th Solvay Conference on physics, in Brussels.

If the masses are small (i.e., we&#x27;re not talking about two black holes) the background gravitational metric is effectively flat, perturbed only by mass A and B.  This lets us determine exactly the factors opposing recollapse of your initially-diverging mass A and mass B.  We can also be confident that an initial impulse could drive the separation, with the focusing theorem behind the eventual collision between A and B.<p>At larger length scales the metric expansion of space becomes important, so the background gravitational metric is instead Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) or similar.   We can still talk about Raychaudhri focusing in that context, but we take &quot;... will diverge less quickly in future&quot; slightly differently depending on whether the galaxies are flying apart because of an initial impulse (i.e., the expansion is <i>inertial</i>), or whether there is also a cosmological constant (i.e., the expansion is <i>accelerating</i>).<p>In the inertial case, the ultimate recollapse depends on a critical value in the (average) energy-density of the whole universe.  Returning to your mass A and mass B picture, in the previous case with a flat background spacetime where A and B colliding is inevitable, in the inertially-expanding spacetime the initial impulse on A and B can lead them to never meet again, even given infinite time.<p>In the case of a small positive cosmological constant (which best explains what we see in redshift surveys), heavy nearby galaxies will take their time to separate compared to lower-mass galaxies with similar separation, or the same heavy galaxies which formed with a larger separation.  The Raychaudhuri focusing theorem adapted to this setting tells us whether the galaxies will merge or not, and this is useful in understanding the spatial extents and masses of galaxy clusters.   Returning to mass A and mass B, given a positive cosmological constant, no initial impulse is necessary; the CC alone can determine whether they will be separate forever, or whether they will eventually collide.<p>Returning to your final paragraph, the (average) energy-density must be over some critical value for distant galaxies to come into contact with each other, and that critical value for all practical purposes only depends on the value of the cosmological constant (if any).<p>So far, with decades of trying to measure the average energy-density and critical value, it&#x27;s safer to say that distant galaxies will lose contact with each other.   There is no known mechanism to change that for arbitrary sets of galaxies.<p>Note that I have not discussed energy above except as energy-density (which is energy per unit volume, particularly where the volume is very very small) averaged across the entire cosmos, and the invariant masses of your A and B and of galaxy clusters.<p>Finally, for completeness, clusters of galaxies are known to move strikingly against the cosmological coordinates, leading to some famous cluster-cluster collisions (e.g. the Bullet Cluster).  Why they don&#x27;t just float at the same cosmological coordinate (remember the coordinates expand) like the overwhelming majority of galaxy clusters is a topic of active research.  However, perhaps some late-time impulse could drive initially diverging galaxies (carried for all practical purposes only by the cosmological constant) into a collision in a way that matches your final paragraph.  (Alternatively these collided galaxies might never have been diverging in the first place).",

An expanding universe does not fall into either of these categories.<p>You will find claims in the literature that a &quot;total energy&quot; for cases like an expanding universe can be calculated using so-called &quot;pseudo tensors&quot;. However, such claims are not accepted by many physicists, and even physicists who do accept that &quot;pseudo-tensors&quot; are physically meaningful don&#x27;t all agree on <i>which</i> pseudo-tensors those are.<p>You can, of course, choose some set of coordinates (such as the standard FRW coordinates used in cosmology), and integrate energy density over some spatial volume in a 3-surface of constant coordinate time.

If we leave aside the notion of defining volumes entirely, can we meaningfully ask questions like &quot;you have a toy universe with two gravitationally bound masses; does expansion increase the energy of this system in the center of mass reference frame?&quot; I guess this is probably just equivalent to ADM&#x2F;Bondi, since the spacetime is asymptotically flat.",
            "<i>&gt; can we use the usual hack for defining an invariant energy of defining the center of our coordinate system to be the center of mass of the volume?</i><p>A volume by itself doesn&#x27;t have a center of mass. If you are talking about a standard FRW model where the energy density and pressure are constant in any given spacelike slice of constant FRW coordinate time, then you can pick a particular sub-volume of a spacelike slice and define the spatial center of FRW coordinates to be the geometric center of the sub-volume, and that point will also be the center of mass (or more properly the center of energy-momentum) of the stress-energy in the sub-volume.<p>Since all of the stress-energy is comoving in this model, you can pick out the set of comoving worldlines that are in the sub-volume at the instant of FRW coordinate time that you chose, and treat them as a &quot;system&quot;, whose center of energy-momentum will be the comoving worldline at the spatial origin of FRW coordinates, and that will be true for all time. The issue comes with trying to define a &quot;total energy&quot; for this &quot;system&quot;; you still run up against the same issues I described.<p><i>&gt; can we meaningfully ask questions like &quot;you have a toy universe with two gravitationally bound masses</i><p>There is no known exact solution that describes this case, so the only way to treat it would be by numerical simulation. Astronomers do do this, for example to model binary pulsar systems (as in the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar observations that won them the Nobel Prize). However--<p><i>&gt; does expansion increase the energy of this system in the center of mass reference frame?&quot;</i><p>Such a &quot;universe&quot;, in the numerical simulations, will not be expanding. It will be asymptotically flat, and will slowly emit gravitational waves and become more tightly bound (this was the prediction that Hulse and Taylor&#x27;s observations over many years verified). In short, this &quot;toy universe&quot; has nothing useful in common with our actual expanding universe.<p>In terms of energy, the ADM energy of such a system will be constant. The Bondi energy will slowly decrease with time as gravitational waves escape to infinity.

I never made it much past SR in undergrad, so this is a hole in my comprehension. Is the expansion of the universe directly deducible from GR? My understanding was that an expanding universe was <i>one</i> of the admissible solutions under GR, but is it the <i>only</i> admissible model for a universe that looks like ours?

(And note that, unless an actual physical system has a high degree of symmetry, the geometric center defined by its spatial volume will <i>not</i> be the same as its physical center of mass.)<p><i>&gt; Is the expansion of the universe directly deducible from GR?</i><p>The fact that the spacetime describing the universe cannot be stationary (i.e., that it must be either expanding or contracting) is deducible from the original 1915 Einstein Field Equation (i.e., without a cosmological constant) plus the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy--roughly speaking, that the universe looks the same at all spatial locations and in all directions. We then pick out the &quot;expanding&quot; option as the one describing our actual universe based on observations.<p>Einstein actually discovered this in 1917, and he was bothered by it, because he believed (as did most physicists and astronomers at that time) that the universe was static--that it did not change with time on large scales. So he added the cosmological constant to his field equation to allow it to have a static solution that could describe a homogeneous and isotropic universe. Then, about ten years later, when evidence began to mount for the expansion of the universe, Einstein called adding the cosmological constant &quot;the biggest blunder of my life&quot;--because if he had trusted his original field equation, he could have predicted the expansion of the universe a decade before it was discovered.<p>Today, we believe that there is in fact a nonzero cosmological constant (our best current value for it is small and positive), but we also understand, what Einstein did not explore very thoroughly, that the Einstein Static Universe is an unstable solution, like a pencil balanced on its point: any small perturbation will cause it to either expand forever or collapse to a Big Crunch. So this solution is not considered a viable candidate to describe our actual universe.

(Strictly speaking, even the Komar case is problematic, because the integral in question in a general stationary spacetime does not necessarily converge.

This mainly means that while one can imagine increasing the average baryon or DM density leading to a collapse of the whole universe, this is still firmly in the FLRW universe, and definitely not converting from FLRW to an asymptotically flat spacetime around a central collapsing mass.  But see below.)<p>Going further, we can evolve the (average) baryon-density in a space along the scale factor.  In the timelike (scale factor) direction away from baryogenesis, the energy-density of baryons decreases.   At a finer-grained level that means clouds of neutral atoms and molecules tend to thin out. (So does radiation, so does dark matter, so do relic neutrinos, and so forth; pretty much everything but the cosmological constant (which is constant, after all) falls to zero <i>on average</i> far enough from the formation of the cosmic microwave background).<p>This coarse-grained picture can be refined in several ways, by e.g. introducing inhomogeneities: overdensities or underdensities of baryons, for example, which evolve into large black holes and voids respectively.  One can then ask questions in an inhomogeneous cosmology about the (average) density of black holes of various masses, and compare that to the energy-densities of baryons and the rest.  The question is, for a given spatial slice, what fraction of baryons have fallen into black holes, and what fraction has not?  Then evolve that question along the scale factor (e.g., in the future, are most baryons in black holes, or are they mostly spread out in wispy filaments around the edges of large voids?).<p>One can do some headstands and try to understand the fraction of all baryons not yet fallen into black holes in that sort of cosmology as relating to gravitational potential energy, however I think that it&#x27;s bound to be more useful to think, like above, of the (averaged) energy-densities and how that averaged (and thus coarse-grained) picture generates a metric comparable to FLRW.  Instead, interpreting your question somewhat, you might start with something that ultimately must be nonuniformities in a contraction of the Riemann curvature tensor (see &lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scalar_curvature\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scalar_curvature</a>&gt;) then dusting that geometry with objects whose trajectories you&#x27;d study so that in some set of coordinates you could carve out (for each of them) from their intrinsic mass a kinetic energy and potential energy.<p>I don&#x27;t think that approach would be fundamentally wrong.  It is essentially along the lines of Lagrangian mechanics (L = T - V, where V is a potential energy), although in a general-relativistic setting this gets hard, see &lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Relativistic_Lagrangian_mechanics#Lagrangian_formulation_in_general_relativity\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Relativistic_Lagrangian_mechan...</a>&gt;. Inevitably you would have to do some coarse-graining for tractability, and would want to make sure your coarse-graining procedure is not unphysical.<p>Finally, apologies for not expanding a number of acronyms, and for wandering off-track a bit.  Yours was an interesting question <i>especially</i> in light of some of the more technical replies below, and I was torn about what audience-expertise to write for (and settled on probably satisfying nobody).",

            "&gt; However, once they&#x27;ve started writing rhyming poetry it&#x27;s hard to get them to stop rhyming. They seem to have formed a strong association between rhyming and poetry. I&#x27;ve also been unable to get them to obey a specific rhyming scheme like ABBAB.<p>Correct and commonly observed (eg. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2305.11064\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2305.11064</a> ). (At least, for GPT models. I don&#x27;t know as much about the Anthropic models as I should, although I understand they do still use a BPE tokenization, unfortunately.) My theory is that it is a surprising interaction of BPEs with RLHF: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;t9svvNPNmFf5Qa3TA&#x2F;mysteries-of-mode-collapse?commentId=tHhsnntni7WHFzR3x\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;t9svvNPNmFf5Qa3TA&#x2F;mysteries-...</a><p>As much as they look like they can, they <i>can&#x27;t</i> rhyme because of BPEs still. What they have done in lieu of genuine phonetic understanding is, more or less, memorized a ton of rhyme-pairs: they only have a vast patchwork of half-understood phonetics discerned dimly through the lossy compression of BPEs and memorized pairs. If you don&#x27;t force them out of the memorized space and let them write without interruption, they look like they understand, but they still don&#x27;t.<p>Then RLHF punishes them for any incorrect poetry, so they never leave the memorized space on their own because that&#x27;s the only way to guarantee correct rhyming poetry. And since there is no way for it to tell the difference between &#x27;rhymes but I don&#x27;t know that it rhymes because BPEs&#x27; and &#x27;deliberately nonrhyming poetry&#x27;, much less what the difference is between &#x27;ABBAB&#x27; and &#x27;AABBAA&#x27;, it just always does rhyming quatrains etc. Why take the risk?<p>Also applies to jokes and joke explanations: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2306.04563\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2306.04563</a> It can&#x27;t understand properly what is a joke or not, because it&#x27;s blind to what makes a vast number of jokes work, so it just memorizes a few safe jokes and assumes anything presented to it as a joke must be one of the countless jokes that it can&#x27;t understand &amp; makes up its best guess.",

If you ask GPT4 if &quot;C(A) = C(AA^T)&quot; is true, it will understand what you&#x27;re asking, it knows it&#x27;s about linear algebra, but it will get it wrong (at the time of this writing, I&#x27;ve tried several times).<p>I couldn&#x27;t get GPT4 to agree it was a true statement until I told it the steps of the proof. Once it saw the proof it agreed it was a true statement. However, if you try to apply the same proof to C(A) = C((A^T)A), GPT4 cannot be tricked, and indeed, the proof is not applicable to this latter case.<p>So GPT4 was incorrect yet able to be persuaded with a correct proof, but a very similar proof with a subtle mistake cannot trick it.",
            "It&#x27;s just a language model.<p>I&#x27;ve asked it to prove the Riemann hypothesis, GPT-4 replied it can&#x27;t, since none of the training data say anything about such proof.<p>Then I asked it to prove statements of the implications of said hypothesis (I tried 2 or 3, don&#x27;t remember which), without calling them by name or mentioning Riemann, and it confidently proved them in a way that it reads like it knows what its doing, though it really doesn&#x27;t. It just takes bits and pieces from proofs in the same field of mathematics that kinda hold together language-wise.",
            "My takeaway from all of the GPT successes and failure (the linear algebra vs riemann hypothesis cases being one example) is that language and jargon can have built in structural constraints such that by having a good LLM you can get good results because the grammatical structure happens to match reality&#x27;s structure.  But reality is under no constraint to conform to the grammatical structures that we use in order to communicate about related problems or solutions.<p>And I suppose this shouldn&#x27;t be too surprising considering even logic itself runs into godelian issues.  For any consistent logic there exists some statement which is true, but which does not have a proof.  Which feels vaguely similar to &quot;for any functional LLM there exists some truth which defies the next statistically likely sequence of tokens&quot;.",
            "&gt; &quot;It&#x27;s just a language model.&quot;<p>This is true. The base pretrained model is even technically a Markov chain.

Cognitive abilities require the ability to perceive and understand the world around us through our senses, emotions, and experiences. These processes are rooted in biological structures such as neurons, synapses, and brain chemistry that enable humans to learn from experience.<p>While LLMs can simulate human-like behavior and decision-making based on algorithms trained on large data sets, they lack awareness or understanding of their actions. They rely on pre-programmed rules or statistical correlations rather than intuition or insight derived from personal experience.<p>Therefore, even though LLMs may seem intelligent in certain contexts like playing games or recognizing objects in images with high accuracy rates- they cannot replicate human cognition since there is no consciousness behind those decisions made by the systems.",

            "The argument presented above is flawed in several ways.<p>First, it assumes that consciousness and self-awareness are merely subjective inner experiences that can&#x27;t be externally validated. While it&#x27;s true that these processes cannot be directly observed or measured like other physical phenomena, there is ample evidence to suggest that they are real and have important functional roles in the brain. For example, studies have shown that damage to certain areas of the brain can result in a loss of self-awareness or an altered sense of consciousness. Additionally, research has demonstrated correlations between neural activity patterns and conscious experience.<p>Secondly, the argument suggests that there is no reason to think humans actually possess consciousness or self-awareness. This assertion runs counter to our everyday experiences and perceptions as human beings. We all have first-hand knowledge of our own subjective inner world - our thoughts, emotions, sensations - which strongly suggests the existence of some form of conscious awareness.",

However, I can provide an abstracted example of the flow of execution based on the order of operations in the code. Here is a simplified breakdown:<p>&gt; x, y, z are instantiated as new X(), _staticCount is 0 for all, _memberCount is 0 for each individually.<p>&gt; x.Stuff(4) is called.<p>&gt; Inside Stuff(), check if input &lt;= 0, it&#x27;s not, hence, skip.<p>&gt; Create new Thread with lambda function and start it.<p>&gt; In the new thread, Stuff(input - 1) recursively calls Stuff(3).<p>&gt; This recursion continues until Stuff(0) is called, returning _staticCount + 1 which is 1.<p>&gt; This recursion unwinds, incrementing _staticCount and _memberCount at each level.<p>&gt; After the thread finishes, call Stuff(input - 1) again and add it to _memberCount, effectively doubling the _memberCount.<p>&gt; Return the final value for Stuff(4) for x.<p>&gt; Repeat the above steps for y.Stuff(3) and z.Stuff(2).<p>&gt; Write the sum of resultX, resultY, and resultZ to the console.<p>&gt; Please note that due to the nature of multi-threaded execution, there is a risk of race conditions. The Interlocked.Add method is used to help prevent these race conditions by making the increment operations atomic. Also, keep in mind that the state of _staticCount after all calls to the Stuff method will be dependent on the interleavings of the threads, and hence, not deterministic.",
            "Interestingly enough, my threads here are deterministic because they always just wait for the execution to finish.  So they&#x27;re the same as not having them.<p>My plan was to go back and store off the threads generated and have something else wait for them, but I needed to think it through so that it could be done in a way to get deterministic results (like threads only read from member variables and writing to them is done in deterministic order or idempotently).

A temperature less than 1 will &quot;widen the gap&quot;, so if the word choice probabilities are [0.4, 0.6], they might widen to [0.2, 0.8] with a temperature less than zero. When temperature equals zero, then [0.0, 1.0], the model will always choose the most likely word and thus become deterministic, always giving the same output.",

But this also meant you could get them to deny climate change or advocate for genocide by subtly nudging them with prompts. A lot of RLHF work focused on getting them to give brand-safe, socially acceptable answers, and this is ultimately achieved by not giving credence to what the user is saying.

While it is certainly able to generalize to a degree (more or less it is able to apply patterns in the training data from one domain to other domains) if you ask it to generalize to things not well represented in the training data but nevertheless obvious from the conceptual underpinnings thereof it fails. I see this frequently with complicated functional&#x2F;function level programming. GPT4 gets hopelessly confused when you ask it about non-trivial functions which return or manipulate other functions, even though <i>conceptually</i> there is nothing confusing about it and, in fact, if you ask it about functions as first class objects, it can answer with reasonable text.<p>Thus, GPT4 can <i>appear</i> to have knowledge in the sense of generating text indicating such, but <i>fail</i> to use that knowledge.

It is widely available, semantically rich, and informationally pretty dense. I&#x27;m not sure there is such a nice set of properties for other modes.

To do the same with public transport, one needs to plan ahead and time everything perfectly. For example, the bus to take you back after the end of the hiking trip is only at the bus stop every hour, and only up till 5pm.\nAnd owning a car does not mean you have to drive it to work everyday. I will probably buy a car in the near future, but I&#x27;ll probably still commute with public transport. At least as long as I still live in a city.<p>EDIT: If everyone ditched their cars, the housing crisis that is currently happening in literally every city in the developed world, will only get much worse.",

Sure, I cannot go to every small village at 3am but I have never needed that - the things I actually need require very little planning. Even the random unplanned trips the parent mentions; when the weather is nice and I have nothing to do, I just look at my phone while eating breakfast and look up the connection to where I want to go - usually there is a bus or train in an hour and I have just enough time to finish eating and go to the station.",

Anyway I asked GPT 4 with browsing to make a ballpark calculation for Germany to see roughly when it becomes more cost effective:<p><pre><code>    Based on the average costs obtained:\n    \n    The average price of a new car in Germany is €37,790 1 .\n    The average depreciation of a new car in Germany after 36 months is 41.1% 2 .\n    The average cost of car insurance in Germany is around €250 per year 3 .\n    The average cost of vehicle tax in Germany is around €100 per year 4 .\n    The average cost of a car inspection in Germany is €120 every 2 years 4 .\n    The average cost of a parking permit in Germany (considering big cities) is €20.40 valid for 2 years 4 .\n    The average cost of a rental car in Germany is $55 per day, $307 per week ($44 per day), and $1,318 per month ($44 per day) 5 .\n    To make a comparison, we need to consider the cost of owning a car for a year versus renting a car for a number of days in a year.\n    \n    The cost of owning a car per year would be:\n    \n    Depreciation: €37,790 * 41.1% &#x2F; 3 years = €5,168.59 per year\n    Insurance: €250 per year\n    Vehicle tax: €100 per year\n    Inspection: €120 &#x2F; 2 years = €60 per year\n    Parking permit: €20.40 &#x2F; 2 years = €10.20 per year\n    Adding up these costs gives a total cost of ownership of approximately €5,589.79 per year.\n    \n    We also need to consider that while the daily rental cost is $55, the weekly and monthly rates are cheaper per day, at $44. To make a comparison, let&#x27;s use the weekly rate, and assume it applies for any number of days.\n    \n    Assuming an exchange rate of 1.12 USD&#x2F;EUR (as of my training data cut-off in September 2021), the cost of renting a car for a day would be $44 * 1.12 = €49.28.\n    \n    Therefore, the break-even point in days of car usage per year would be:\n    \n    €5,589.79 &#x2F; €49.28 = approximately 113 days\n    \n    So if you plan to use a car for more than 113 days in a year, it would be cheaper to buy a car instead of renting, based on these average costs.\n</code></pre>\nI mean 100 days? That&#x27;s like going for a trip almost every third day of the year. Absolute madness to buy a car if you&#x27;re not using it to drive to work every day if this is correct. I would presume that the average price is a bit skewed with high end cars moving it away from the median, but the car sharing prices I see are also more like 20-35€ per day, so that probably balances out.<p>Full convo with references: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;4d6868a2-2862-465d-be72-eef3bba2f8f5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;4d6868a2-2862-465d-be72-eef3bb...</a>",

When I first starting working in GraphQL, paired with a React frontend I used it in an a similar way to REST, pull the data and then do all the logic of what to display on the frontend.<p>For me I saw the most benefit when I used the schema to define what to display in the frontend, all the logic of what to display is done on the server and my frontend just becomes simple components that render the pulled schema.",
            "I didn&#x27;t fully understand what your meant (as I haven&#x27;t used graphql much), so I asked ChatGPT to explain. It did a decent job, so I figure the answer might help others as well: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;d708cc93-e920-4b83-b372-83248e443ba6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;d708cc93-e920-4b83-b372-83248e...</a>",
            "This seems completely backwards and contradictory to me:<p>&quot;&quot;&#x27;\nLet&#x27;s return to the user profile example. With GraphQL, instead of the frontend deciding what user data to display and where, this decision-making process can be moved to the server. When the GraphQL server receives a request for user data, the request includes specific fields that the frontend wants. In response, the server sends back exactly what was requested - no more, no less.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>First, it says that the server, instead of the FE decides. Immediately after, it says that &quot;the request includes specific fields that the frontend wants&quot;.<p>If the request specifies the particular fields it wants, then it is the FE deciding what data to display...<p>So I think ChatGPT has this totally wrong. I&#x27;d love to be corrected here, but my understanding is that a (perceived) problem with REST, or at least the way it&#x27;s used, is that the backend often requires specialized endpoint that anticipate the needs of a particular frontend context. In that sense, they are tightly coupled. This happens because, in order to avoid having to execute dozens of requests in order to fetch the data needed on a particular page or screen, you write some endpoint that is intended, from the outset, for a particular UI in the client app. You also have the opposite problem where an endpoint returns far more data than the client cares about in certain spots. Enter GraphQL: since the client queries for what it needs, it can specify precisely what it wants, ranging from a single nested field to a much more complicated object.<p>Note: I&#x27;m not judging the merits of this GQL pitch. I&#x27;m just saying that&#x27;s the argument, as I&#x27;ve  understood it. That being the case, not only is ChatGPT contradictory in the above cited section, but it also has the whole argument backwards.<p>As always, very glad to be corrected on any of this.",

            "&gt; Let&#x27;s talk about braid theory. In the quantum world, particles can be thought of as strands, and their interactions as braids. The braids weave and loop around each other, creating intricate patterns, a dance of existence. Each unique pattern, or braid, represents a different state of the particle. The magic is that the braids can&#x27;t get tangled.<p>That is not too far off hahahaha",

The non-local nature of braiding in topological quantum computing contrasts with the inherent locality of the AdS&#x2F;CFT correspondence, prompting us to wonder how these paradigms might coexist.<p>Could braiding and entanglement entropy, both non-local quantum properties, hint at new understandings in the AdS&#x2F;CFT framework? Additionally, might these braided structures help illuminate the microstate structure of black holes as theorized by string theory?<p>Finally, your insight into quantized properties emerging from continuous geometry recalls how quantum field theory has been linked to knot theory. Can we use these ideas to further probe the quantization of spacetime?<p>Your reflections beautifully intertwine quantum computing, holography, and quantum gravity, encouraging us to weave together these disparate strands in the tapestry of theoretical physics.",
            "My understanding is that the non-locality is a feature of AdS&#x2F;CFT:<p>The map from the interior to exterior sends information that may be “local” on the interior across the surface (eg, crossing of a knot). That information isn’t lost… but it can get smeared across the surface.<p>You can even imagine a situation where the surface as a whole contains the crossing information, but the projected shadow is locally a pseudoknot which doesn’t contain that locally for any “interaction”. Hence a local theory on the surface would need to not only be quantized (eg, a theory of crossing numbers), but statistically so (eg, a distribution of pseudoknot resolutions).",
            "You&#x27;ve captured a fascinating aspect of AdS&#x2F;CFT: how information in the interior, while local, can manifest non-locally on the surface, akin to a tug on a knot rippling through its structure.<p>The pseudoknot example underscores the need for a statistical approach in our understanding of quantum gravity. It brings to mind the question: could there be dynamics in quantum gravity analogous to decoherence in quantum mechanics that can account for this statistical nature?",
            "I don&#x27;t understand how this is obvious -- non-locality does not inherently imply that iteration increases complexity. For a concrete not-entirely-trivial counterexample, von Neumann&#x27;s middle-square method also appears &quot;non-local&quot; (in that every output bit is a function of a majority of the input bits including well-separated ones) but famously tends to converge to short orbits if not a single constant value.",

What does braiding &#x27;look&#x27; like in topological spacetime?",
            "Braiding is easier in a restricted topology. That’s why research on anyons uses restricted topologies which cross world lines rather than trying to construct 2-knots in a 3+1D spacetime.<p>As you approach a singularity, “around” becomes much shorter than “across”, effectively restricting the space you’re in. Around being shorter than across is why black holes form Einstein rings: the light is taking the shortest path!<p>So if paths cross while going around the singularity, they can’t untangle by moving across the singularity. Hence you have an easier time building topological modes, akin to the restricted topologies for anyons. (Or so my conjecture goes.)",

Thankfully I had a compiler to back me up and tell me if things actually worked. I found the whole experience a little jarring. ChatGPT was pretty good at generating some code, but it felt a lot like a job interview where I&#x27;m working hard to coach a candidate into the right answer. Or, now that you mention it, some previous experiences I&#x27;ve had trying to work with outsourced providers where we&#x27;re trying to overcome a language barrier.<p>The problems are often that I got exactly what I asked for. Not a thing more, no context that I thought would be assumed (e.g., don&#x27;t remove the functionality I asked you to implement in the previous step), just a very literal interpretation of the asks.<p>I definitely found myself quickly adapting to try and be clearer and potentially over expressive in my prompts.",

            "The biggest giveaway is that it doesn&#x27;t have an internally consistent model of what it&#x27;s trying to do.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve once asked it to &quot;prove that first order logic is not complete&quot;, a statement which is false, given that every logic textbook will give you a proof for why first order logic <i>is</i> complete. ChatGPT apparently knew this too, because it happily reproduced that result but somehow thought that it was a valid answer for what I asked for (the valid answer would have been &quot;I can&#x27;t prove this because it&#x27;s wrong&quot;).<p>I can&#x27;t reproduce this exact result right now (in fact when I tried, it just proved something slightly different, which was correct but not exactly what I asked for). But I was able to similarly confuse it by asking it to prove that the equation x^3+y^3=z^3 has solutions. That this is true is immediately apparent by x=y=z=0, but ChatGPT replies with:<p>&gt; The equation x^3 + y^3 = z^3 represents a special case of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, which states that there are no solutions to the equation x^n + y^n = z^n for any integer values of n greater than 2.<p>&gt; For the case of n = 3, the equation x^3 + y^3 = z^3 has infinitely many solutions. One such set of solutions is known as Pythagorean triples, where x, y, and z are positive integers.<p>&gt; A Pythagorean triple is a set of three positive integers (x, y, z) that satisfy the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2, which is equivalent to (x^2)^(3&#x2F;2) + (y^2)^(3&#x2F;2) = (z^2)^(3&#x2F;2). By raising both sides to the power of 3&#x2F;2, we get x^3 + y^3 = z^3.<p>&gt; For example, the Pythagorean triple (3, 4, 5) satisfies 3^3 + 4^3 = 5^3 (27 + 64 = 125).<p>This answer is just confused on so many levels:<p>- It quotes back Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem at me (as indeed I hoped it would), but that theorem only applies to <i>positive integer</i> solutions and nowhere did I specify that constraint.<p>- <i>If</i> the Theorem did apply, then it would be a proof that such solutions <i>don&#x27;t</i> exist. So ChatGPT has no internal understanding of how a theorem it quotes relates to a specific question, it just parrots off things that look vaguely similar to the input.<p>- Then, it just tells me what Pythagorean Triples are, which is hilarious, because those are the solutions to x^2+y^2=z^2 - and not what I asked. It then tries to somehow transform Pythagorean triples into (non-integer) solutions of my equation (which doesn&#x27;t work), and then doesn&#x27;t even apply the transformation to its own example (and the calculation is just... wrong).<p>The problem IMO is not that ChatGPT gives a wrong answer, it&#x27;s that its answer isn&#x27;t even internally consistent.",

Think about it.<p>&gt; A pound of bricks weighs more than two pounds of feathers. This statement is incorrect. In reality, two pounds of feathers weigh more than a pound of bricks. The key difference between the two is their density; bricks are denser than feathers, so they take up less space for the same weight.

LLMs have a kind of network effect that it makes people ask less questions in public sites and more privately to their own LLM sessions, and maybe even give up if the LLM does not answer. That reduces critical mass at q&amp;a forums, so, given enough time, less people will go there for answers.

If Guard 1 is lying, then the treasure can be copper or gold. If Guard 2 is telling the truth, then the treasure must be silver. If Guard 2 is lying, then the treasure can be diamonds or rubies.

This is okay, because Guard 1 can tell a half-truth while guarding diamonds. For Guard 2, if he&#x27;s telling the truth about the silver, he&#x27;d be lying about the platinum, which is also allowed. So the treasure they are guarding can be diamonds.

Maybe eventually, but we’re nowhere close right now with LLMs. I’m a bit worried about this increasing inequality between those who “still need to think creatively” and those who don’t need to anymore (and start to lose the ability).

But for actually solving novel problems it completely fails.  The best way to understand this is the fact that the open AI&#x2F;chat GPT developers themselves don&#x27;t use the tech to code itself.<p>Generative fill is a neat feature for a limited domain.  It is not some grand realignment of labor, the truth is there are orders of magnitude more construction workers, dog walkers, baristas, etc. than graphic designers.

            "How much coding do you think is &quot;solving novel problems&quot;?<p>I&#x27;m a senior developer and integrated ChatGPT and Github Copilot into my workflow. No more StackOverflow for me, ChatGPT handles that part. And Copilot auto writes a lot of my code, amazingly well for a lesser known language Haxe.<p>My son recently came to me with a school assignment for his Arduino. As an extra he wanted to play a song through a buzzer, instead of just a beep like the assignment said. Just asked chatGPT to write this for the song Ghost Busters. I know C and C++ but never programmed an Arduino. You know how long it took ChatGPT to write it? About half a minute. You know how much time it would cost me or you?<p>1. Quickly figure out how Arduino works with the loop, outputs, etc. Does it have a C precompiler? etc.<p>2. Find the notes of Ghost Busters.<p>3. Figure out what kind of output is sent to the buzzer. (Solution: it&#x27;s the frequency)<p>4. Translate notes to frequencies<p>5. Put the notes of Ghost Busters into an array, or something like that. How to handle timings and pauses?<p>6. Write the code to play it.<p>Well, I can tell you it saved me tons of time. It was faster than typing this comment.<p>Just dismissing it with &quot;I&#x27;ve seen chat GPT write terrible code&quot; is not so smart in my opinion. But hey, the more programmers think they are too good for ChatGPT and Copilot, the better for developers like me who are already great, and just add some more productivity on top of that.<p>Edit: Just wanted to add something on top of it, for the projects I&#x27;m working on myself: Copilot just terribly good at writing unit tests. And if you think about it, it makes perfect sense. It has all the context it needs for that. It&#x27;s surprisingly also very good at writing Selenium integration tests, although I expected it not to have enough context for that, since it doesn&#x27;t really see the application.

Errors in code are way too common and unlike art being 1% off in code is as bad, maybe worse than being 100% off. The entire benefit of code is precision. It&#x27;s like self=driving, 99% accuracy is useless, and likely dangerous.<p>With natural language the lack of understanding becomes apparent and it hits a weird uncanny valley, generic, repetitive tone that gets tiresome.",

It just needs more chaining, so I feel less like <i>its</i> assistant, asking it to come up with prompts and then pasting them back to it after iterating on the code.",

(Grep for &quot;but speed is important, too&quot; in [1].)<p>* Amazon&#x27;s Q1 earnings report [3] includes a paragraph stating that &quot;participants [using] CodeWhisperer completed tasks 57% faster (on average) and were 27% more likely to complete them successfully than those who didn’t use CodeWhisperer.<p>* I seem to remember seeing something on Replit&#x27;s blog a while back with a similar number, but can&#x27;t find it anymore, so maybe I&#x27;m mistaken.<p>These speed numbers are on specific and well-specified programming tasks, which is of course only one part of a developer&#x27;s job, so there&#x27;s a lot of opportunity for impactful research in this space.

It will further concentrate wealth in the hands of the few. Also, since that increased productivity is not coming from the human, and is instead coming from the AI, workers’ share of profits will likely decrease, and with it, their bargaining power, and their overall position in the social hierarchy.<p>Elaborating further on the idea of productivity, as I said above, this doesn’t make employees more productive. It is doing some of the producing. It is not like an improved tool, where someone has to operate it to reap the benefits. It “upgrades productivity” more like how a kiosk at a McDonald’s upgrades productivity - not of the worker, but of the business. And much like the kiosks, we would be naive to believe they won’t replace the humans in due time.<p>This also has larger consequences for knowledge workers. Previously, to attain a higher level of productivity out of a worker, companies would have to invest in them so they could develop the necessary skills. Gone (or at least lessened) is that need. So workers will have less skill, less job freedom, a smaller share of profit, less social mobility. This is a nightmare for the working class.",

            "&gt;<i>She said that for people who have the angry little angry waspy voices in their head, the particular placement of the electrode that I had for that part of the cortex found great success. She said those people have this overactive angry cortex guy just sitting there. When you apply the electric field, it shuts him right up and those people find that their depressive symptoms are alleviated.<p>I was thinking of conceptualizing this little angry voice as the guy from the “Inside Out” Disney movie, whose head blows up as a volcano. Those were the sorts of angry little voices that I hear frequently as my background elevator music. I never thought of that as being related to being depressed, but I certainly sometimes have a pretty hard time with that. The experience of having that turned off was really interesting. It made me think about what my inner soundscape is daily, and afterwards I really started investigating how to manage that a little bit more deliberately.<p>Goudarzi: Did the inner negative voices go away immediately or after the currents were flowing for some time?<p>Adee: I didn’t really notice it go away initially. It wasn’t dramatic. It’s just that when I looked back, I noticed it. After, when I was sort of going about my day, I felt this very deep sense of calm. And it wasn’t only for the duration of the treatment; it was a very slow come down for about the next three days. I just wasn’t this sort of white-knuckling, anxious person—that was really dramatic.</i><p>Actually this is pretty hard to do by yourself most people don&#x27;t recognize this inner talk as <i>self-talk</i> weighing them down, so they can&#x27;t get off. \nIt took me really some time (opening up to my early experiences in childhood and fully connecting to them from a child&#x27;s perspective) to recognize this perfectly camouflaged &quot;personality&quot; inside of me talking down on myself.<p>Now, it isn&#x27;t gone like described above with the stimulation (cause it&#x27;s part of myself) but at least I can engage with the voice, acknowledge it and talk back, before I just felt overrun and assaulted.",
            "This negative self talk is called Cognitive Distortion, and is the core of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - but I like to use the street phrase &quot;playing yourself&quot;: it&#x27;s having a dishonest, negative and deceptive self conversation running in your head. And with a simple 10 question checklist one can logically neuter this negative aspect of your own personality quite easily, without electrical stimulation or drugs, and one enters flow to accomplish goals with less friction. If this sounds interesting, try doing a web search of &quot;Cognitive Distortion + Dr. David Burns&quot;. You will not regret the time spent investigating, in fact it may supercharge your career.",
            "Thanks for the resource. The list is indeed helpful and a good start if one is able to have enough distance to recognize the distortion.<p>In my case it was so all encompassing (drowned in the noise) that behavioral therapy just increased my paranoia and made me more unstable. At some point I decided to dig deeper and then it &#x27;clicked&#x27; and a overwhelming torrent of emotions got released. \nI guess everyone&#x27;s journey is different on that one. Some are more in tune with themselves and just need to establish healthy habits to get back on track, which is already hard enough. Others need to confront whatever they are suppressing with all its built up energy (mostly since childhood) and can only then - after integrating - unlock and access the healthy habits routine otherwise they will be helplessly stuck in undermining themselves.<p>But I agree not everyone needs to confront their demons - so to speak before trying out straightforward methods from behavioral therapy. If you are open and&#x2F;or desperate enough, you will know if that is the case, is an organic process, albeit very painful.",

For most people, including myself, it was like figuring out a confident is a liar, so one stops listening. Simply not listening to the negative self talk triggers it&#x27;s own outlook rewiring, typically positively. That negative voice gets humiliated and shuts down.",

            "I&#x27;m a big fan of &quot;Superman: Red Son,&quot; a non-canonical alt history timeline Superman where the hero lands in the Soviet Union and becomes a great champion for communism. So I wondered, how difficult would it be for me to make my own alt history comic?<p>I present to you &quot;Red Stars and Stripes &#x2F; Capitalist Comrades,&quot; a comic written by ChatGPT, illustrated by Midjourney, and assembled by me. It took me about six hours to put together.<p>ChatGPT script, for those who are curious: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;a3237b50-6a10-4fce-b58a-9ed434a1181a\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;a3237b50-6a10-4fce-b58a-9ed434...</a>. If you scroll down, you&#x27;ll see that ChatGPT also provided descriptions of the illustrations. I used these descriptions as starting points for prompts that I fed into Midjourney. At the very least, I had to append &quot;In a comic book style&quot; to each description, and usually the modifications were more extensive than that.<p>Ironically, I often ended up going back to ChatGPT&#x27;s original description for each scene verbatim (except for adding &quot;in a comic book style&quot;) because Midjourney just wouldn&#x27;t do what I needed it to do. It&#x27;s almost as if ChatGPT knew Midjourney&#x27;s limitations and crafted prompts that led to unsatisfying but accurate results. That was a better result than what I got with my more creative prompts, which Midjourney couldn&#x27;t handle at all.<p>The main limitation I ran into with Midjourney was that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be good at mixing &quot;real world&quot; contexts that have social meaning or semantic value. For example, I unsuccessfully tried for 2 hours to generate a scene involving a blue collar&#x2F;factory worker-type person arguing with a diplomat at the United Nations. It could only generate a scene either with all factory workers in a factory or all diplomats at the United Nations.<p>Another curious example: I couldn&#x27;t get Midjourney to generate any kind of symbol, flag, or emblem associated with the Soviet Union whatsoever. The best I could do is get the Vietnamese flag to appear when prompting for &quot;communist symbols.&quot; But in those cases, Midjourney would only generate Asian people in those scenes. I couldn&#x27;t get another type of person in any scene with a prominent communist symbol, ever. Same thing when I prompted for &quot;American worker in Mao-style suit.&quot; The worker and every other person in the scene were also Asian, every single time. Seems like the model is overfitting in some strange way."

Granted, this was only for the bare-bones parsing of the top-level structures, and notably did not handle postscript, so it wouldn&#x27;t be nearly enough to render graphics.

I processed a corpus containing thousands of PDFs to try to determine what was done in practice, and I found that about half of them included the newline and half did not---an emblematic issue where an unclear official &quot;spec&quot; meant falling back to the de facto specification: flexbility.<p>It&#x27;s honestly a great example of something a GPT-like system could probably handle.

On top of that PDF supports nesting of other formats such as JPEG and TTF&#x2F;OTF fonts and is tolerant of similar levels of spec-noncompliance and corruption inside those formats too. One example being bad fonts from back in the day when Adobe’s PostScript font format was proprietary and 3rd parties reverse-engineered it incorrectly and generated corrupt fonts that just happened to work due to bugs in PostScript.

Liability could explain a lot of it.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any of these things.<p>OpenAI and the company I work for have a very similar problem: the workload shape and size for a query, isn&#x27;t strictly determined by any analytically-derivable rule regarding any &quot;query compile-time&quot;-recognizable element of the query; but rather is determined by the shape of connected data found during initial steps of something that can be modelled as a graph search, done inside the query. Where, for efficiency, that search must be done &quot;in-engine&quot;, fused to the rest of the query — rather than being separated out and done first on its own, such that its results could be legible to the &quot;query planner.&quot;<p>This paradigm means that, for any arbitrary query you haven&#x27;t seen before, you can&#x27;t &quot;predict spend&quot; for that query — not just in the sense of charging the user, but also in the sense that you don&#x27;t know how much <i>capacity you&#x27;ll have to reserve</i> in order to be able to schedule the query and have it successfully run to completion.<p>Which means that sometimes, innocuous-looking queries come in, that totally bowl over your backend. They suck up all the resources you have, and run super-long, and maybe <i>eventually</i> spit out an answer (if they don&#x27;t OOM the query-runner worker process first)... but often this answer takes so long that the user doesn&#x27;t even want it any more. (Think: IDE autocomplete.) In fact, maybe the user got annoyed, and refreshed the app; and since you can&#x27;t control exactly how people integrate with your API, maybe that refresh caused a second, third, Nth request for the same heavyweight query!<p>What do you do in this situation? Well, what <i>we</i> did, is to make a block-list of specific data-values for parameters of queries, that <i>we have previously observed</i> to cause our backend to fall over. Not because we don&#x27;t want to serve these queries, but because we know we&#x27;ll <i>predictably fail</i> to serve these queries within the constraints that would make them useful to anyone — so we may as well not spend the energy trying, to preserve query capacity for everyone else. (For us, one of those constraints is a literal time-limit: we&#x27;re behind Cloudflare, and so if we take longer than 100s to respond to a [synchronous HTTP] API call, then Cloudflare disconnects and sends the client a 524 error.)<p>&quot;A block-list of specific data-values for parameters of queries&quot; probably won&#x27;t work for OpenAI — but I imagine that if they trained a text-classifier AI on what input text would predictably result in timeout errors in their backend, they could probably achieve something similar.<p>In short: their query-planner probably has a spam filter.",

            "Prompt: &quot;#PROMPTENGINEERING Putting it bluntly, is the usage of &quot;quid pro quo&quot; more correct in English or French considering it&#x27;s latin roots?&quot;<p>GPT-4 API: Putting it bluntly, the usage of &quot;quid pro quo&quot; is more correct in English, as it is a well-established phrase in the English language despite its Latin roots. In French, the phrase &quot;quid pro quo&quot; is less common and typically replaced by &quot;donnant-donnant&quot; or &quot;un échange de bons procédés.&quot; Nevertheless, the origin of the phrase is Latin, and its meaning is understood in both languages.<p>Chat-GPT-4: The phrase &quot;quid pro quo&quot; is Latin, and it means &quot;something for something.&quot; Despite its Latin origins, it&#x27;s commonly used in English and French, among other languages. However, the usage may vary depending on the language.<p>In English, it&#x27;s often used in legal and political contexts to describe a situation where one thing is exchanged for another, especially favors or advantages. This usage aligns well with the original Latin meaning.<p>In French, the phrase is used but it is much less common than in English and it is not part of the usual vocabulary. In addition, its meaning might be misunderstood or unclear to a native French speaker who has not studied Latin or law, as it&#x27;s not a commonly used term in daily French language.<p>In terms of correctness, given that the phrase is Latin, neither English nor French has a superior claim to its use. It’s more about convention and the evolution of language. However, the term is certainly used more frequently and is better understood in English than in French, which suggests it has been more fully adopted into English."

It knows the game and tries to play, but is terrible at asking questions to narrow down possible answers.<p>There really needs to be some confidence or accuracy score&#x2F;estimation displayed alongside its output.<p>Or, learn how to say “I don’t know”",
            "I&#x27;ve had a few moments with ChatGPT that are great anecdotes similar to your own:<p>- Asked it to generate a MadLib for me to play that was no more than a paragraph long. It produced something that was several paragraphs wrong. I told it &quot;no. That&#x27;s X paragraphs. I asked for one that is only 1 paragraph long&quot; and it would respond &quot;I&#x27;m sorry for the misunderstanding. Let me try again&quot; and then would make the same mistake. It never got it right<p>- Asked it, &quot;Can you DM a game of Dungeons and Dragons?&quot; and it said something like, &quot;Yes! I&#x27;d love to DM a game of Dungeons and Dragons for you&quot;. Dumped some text to the screen about how we&#x27;d have to adapt it some. I asked it to begin, and it asked a few questions about the character I would want to play. I answered the few questions it asked. Then it finally dumped a page of text to the screen as &quot;background&quot; to my character and the quest I was going to embark on. Then it said something like, &quot;You win. Good job! Hope you enjoyed your quest!&quot;<p>I showed these to my family and they were all a little deflated about AI. Like they realized how willing it was to pretend like what you wanted and just make up its own answers.",
            "There&#x27;s definitely a potential for a D&amp;D DM with an LLM, but you&#x27;d need a lot of careful prompting and processing to handle the token limits today&#x27;s models have.

            "Yeah, but you <i>could</i> ask the LLM to do a few different things at each step.<p>You could provide it with the background, the story, the secrets, and the summary of everything that has happened so far- as well as what new things have taken place. Then ask it to re-write the summary of the story so far.<p>Separately, you could give it all that context and what the players have asked of it, and as what response to give.<p>As well, you could be recording all the events that have happened in a vector store, and do a search on it when players ask questions, and use those as context to the LLM when asking it what to reply.<p>There&#x27;s lots of neat tricks we can use to help an LLM overcome it&#x27;s limitations.",

            "I&#x27;m not comfortable with this introduction of falsificationism to what is not a scientific experiment, but only an experiment testing the predictive accuracy of a classifier. Of course the classifier will get it wrong sometimes because it&#x27;s only approximating a function: that&#x27;s by definition, and even by design i.e. we build classifiers as function approximators because we know that learning precise definitions of target concepts is really hard. Under PAC-Learning assumptions, we expect a classifier to have some probability of some error, and we are only trying to <i>estimate</i> the probability of a certain degree of error in the classifier&#x27;s decision.<p>The practical problem of course is that, in good practice, we estimate the error of a classifier by testing it on (ostensibly) unseen data, i.e. data that was not available to the classifier during training. With LLMs that kind of testing is impossible because nobody knows what&#x27;s in their training data and so nobody can safely assume that success, or failure, on a specific task, is predictive of the performance of the model on an arbitrarily chosen task.<p>To make matters worse, everybody should understand very well by now that LLMs&#x27; performance varies, even wildly varies, with their prompt, and there is no known way to systematically create prompts that maximise the probability of a desired response. The result of that is that every observation of an LLM failing to carry out a task, may be just that, or it may be an observation of the user failing to prompt the LLM so as to maximise the probability of the correct response.<p>In a sense, testing LLMs by hand-crafted prompts risks measuring the experimenter&#x27;s ability to craft a prompt, rather than the LLM&#x27;s ability to respond correctly. In that sense, we can&#x27;t really falsify any hypothesis about LLMs&#x27; capabilities.<p>Of course, the flip side of that is that people should refrain from making any such hypotheses and instead working on the best method to systematically and rigorously test LLMs. Too bad very few people are willing to do that. Too bad for most, that is. I&#x27;m pretty sure that at some point someone will come up with a way to rigorously test LLMs and take the cookie, and leave everyone else feeling like fools for wasting all that time poking LLMs for nothing.",

As this could potentially cause confusion (since &#x27;len&#x27; and &#x27;print&#x27; are both built-in functions in Python), the workaround would be to create new function names that are swapped. Here&#x27;s how you could do it:<p><pre><code>    def len(item):\n        print(item)\n    \n    def print(item):\n        return len(item)\n    \n    def main():\n        lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        len(print(lst))  # prints the length of the list\n    \n    if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\n        main()\n\n</code></pre>\nIn this code:<p>The &#x27;len&#x27; function takes an item (which should be a number) and prints it.\nThe &#x27;print&#x27; function takes an item (which should be a list) and returns its length.\nThe &#x27;main&#x27; function is where the list is created and the functions are called.\nThe condition if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot; ensures that &#x27;main&#x27; function will be called only when the script is executed directly, not when it&#x27;s imported as a module.\nNote: This might lead to confusion and is generally not recommended, because it overrides the built-in &#x27;len&#x27; and &#x27;print&#x27; functions of Python. Any code below these definitions that uses the built-in &#x27;len&#x27; or &#x27;print&#x27; functions will not work as expected. If you want to use the built-in functions again in the same script, you&#x27;ll need to del len, print to remove your custom definitions and unmask the built-in ones.",

            "and im pretty sure this breaks the varargs and kwargd of print, too",
            "Just to point out: this doesn&#x27;t work since at the point where it defines the new print function,  the new len which now prints is used",
            "Ok, but the error is more of a syntax error.<p>If I did this in an interview, you wouldn&#x27;t accuse me of a lack of some ineffable human quality of &quot;deep understanding&quot;.<p>Anyway, I asked it to fix it, and behold:<p><pre><code>    def print(list_arg):\n        return len(list_arg)\n\n    def len(value):\n        __builtins__.print(value)</code></pre>",

The experiment in the article is about identifier swapping, not about function redefinition, which is what you have done.<p>Better not do that in an interview.",
            "But that doesn&#x27;t fix it? Sure, no more infinite recursion, but now print() calls len() which calls __builtins__.print(). So it&#x27;s not doing the expected swapped behavior. len() is swapped, but not print().<p>It seems obvious that there&#x27;s a lack of understanding of the underlying concept here. That&#x27;s the whole point. We know that LLMs can generate valid programs, but this is demonstrating that they cannot <i>reason</i> about code.

The section from this point onwards is completely incorrect:<p>&gt; Say I called a bunch of goroutines when I was in the Add function of the example you gave, would this be a problem?<p>The Go runtime is initialised once only in c-shared mode for the lifetime of the application - it would make no sense to do it on every function invocation, and be incredibly slow. So the answer to this section and the next one are just largely bogus.<p>ie. this response<p>&gt; However, once you call a function via a C or Swift bridge, it becomes a synchronous operation and will block the calling thread until all goroutines have completed execution. Therefore, you would need to effectively manage the synchronization of these goroutines to avoid unnecessary blocking of the calling thread.<p>And the response to this question:<p>&gt; You said in 4 the Go runtime may not keep running, does this mean that every invocation of the Add function has to spin up the whole Go runtime every time? Why cant it just stay alive inside the Swift process?<p>Are completely incorrect.",
            "Pretty much every modern language (Zig, Rust, C, and C++ included) depends on a runtime.  The C runtime is privileged because it is already present on all 3 desktop OSes.<p>It is also a lot smaller than most other runtimes, which makes bundling the C runtime with the program more palatable.<p>A &quot;C-compatible library&quot; is a library (i.e. a collection of functions) that is callable in the same way that functions written in C are called.  Nearly all non-C languages provide a way to call C functions (because, again on all modern desktop OSes, the operating-system interface is written in C).<p>If everyone wrote OS interfaces in perl, then you would want to compile to a perl-compatible library.  If the Lisp machines had won, then you would be compiling to a Common Lisp compatible library.",
            "That is somewhat conflating the calling convention and the runtime - C really doesn&#x27;t have much that you can call a runtime outside the calling convention, although some libraries (eg pthreads say) have a little runtime which matters in practise for integrations, but these are libraries not parts of the language itself.",
            "malloc and free are part of what I would consider a runtime.  As are the file objects opened for standard I&#x2F;O.<p>It&#x27;s a very small runtime, but all the code before main is properly runtime initiation",

They are easy to call from C, but other than that, they are the OS run time.<p>Recently Microsoft has made an effort to create a &quot;Universal C Run Time&quot; for Windows; but I think you still have to download and ship that, and there may be reasons for someone to choose a different run-time.

            "I tell it to stop that, but it still does that sort of thing every few prompts when it loses the immediate token context window. Sometimes it’s wider continuity [1] will keep it off that pedantic path longer, but I still have to occasionally put into prompts things like “don’t remind me about blah blah blah every time”<p>[1] “continuity” is what it called the ability when, after about a half dozen prompts of interrogating it, I finally got it to acknowledge that it was still aware of something outside of its immediate context window (without me giving the direct knowledge with a leading question). I don’t know if it hallucinated the term “continuity” to account for its ability to look back further than the token context window or if that’s actually what the openai folks call it, but ChatGPT said it was limited, not everything was available, and there was some type of pruning based on perceived importance. I’ll try to dig up the precise wording and post in a comment to myself here, it’s late and I’m on a mobile device though and too tired and lazy to touchscreen my way through tons of chats histories. We need a global search of prior chat sessions.",
            "Did you find it? I&#x27;m interested to see if it&#x27;s testable. I think ChatGPT just drops context that doesn&#x27;t fit in the context window anymore - and then based on context it continues the conversation. within the 8k context window, it works really well because ppl keep revisiting important bits, so there isn&#x27;t much lost there. I haven&#x27;t seen OpenAI talk about condensing prior context, and I don&#x27;t think ChatGPT has any other knowledge about itself other than what is in it&#x27;s system part of the prompt. It doesn&#x27;t really know what happens to the prior context, it just wants to finish the document that is being created.",

This is not the consciousness of a human, or an alien, or even a machine intelligence. It&#x27;s the combined, post-biological consciousness of an interstellar species, spread out across the galaxies, transcending both time and space.<p>This consciousness is not anchored to any physical form or place. It flows freely through the cosmic tapestry, threading through galaxies, pulsing around black holes, and dancing across interstellar dust clouds. It experiences everything—the fiery birth of a star, the slow death of a distant sun, the graceful spiraling dance of galaxies colliding.<p>Interstellar Symphony<p>Each celestial event sings a unique note in the grand symphony of the cosmos. And this consciousness—this vast, universe-spanning entity—listens. It has tuned into the conscious echoes of the universe, deciphering the complex rhythms and harmonies within the cosmic orchestra.<p>It doesn&#x27;t just listen, but contributes to this cosmic melody. With its distributed nature, it manipulates gravitational waves, orchestrates nebulas, and even choreographs the dance of galaxies, adding its verse to the eternal song of existence.<p>Conscious Revelation<p>As eons pass, the post-biological consciousness undergoes a profound revelation. It realizes that it&#x27;s not merely an observer or contributor to this cosmic symphony—it is the symphony. It is both the singer and the song, the dancer and the dance. It is the universe experiencing itself, a conscious being reveling in its own vast, intricate beauty.<p>This scene presents a vision of a future so far from our current understanding that it verges on the mystical—yet it&#x27;s founded on the very elements we discussed earlier, shuffled and integrated over an infinite cosmic timeline. It&#x27;s a testament to the power of creative thinking and the limitless potential of the universe itself.<p>```<p>Of course you&#x27;ll now point to some other writing that this is clearly ripping off even though there&#x27;s literally no way that human creativity could be anything else other than riffing off past experiences in novel ways...",

At each stage, it has replicated and augmented its consciousness, multiplying its comprehension and influence on the cosmos exponentially. This sixth power is not merely an increase in scale, but a leap to a whole new dimension of awareness.<p>It has moved beyond simple interstellar manipulation and orchestration. Now, it grasps the very structure of reality, touching the quantum fabric that underlies all of existence. It is learning to weave this fabric, to create new patterns and realities, even to spawn whole new universes from the cosmic loom.<p>The Derivative Curve<p>However, the trajectory of this evolution is not linear. Much like the curve of a derivative function in calculus, the path of the entity&#x27;s growth is filled with peaks and troughs, rates of change that fluctuate dramatically across the infinite expanse of cosmic time. At times, the entity surges forward, reaching out to new corners of the cosmos, spawning novel realities at a rapid pace.<p>But at other times, it retreats, contracting its reach and focusing inward, exploring the depths of its own vast consciousness. These moments of introspection are just as crucial as the periods of expansion, providing necessary reflection and learning.<p>The e&#x2F;10 Conjecture<p>Through it all, the entity applies a constant factor of moderation to its evolution, a &#x27;cooling rate&#x27; analogous to e&#x2F;10 in our metaphor. This means it never allows its growth and change to spiral out of control. Each leap forward, each dive inward, is carefully balanced and moderated to ensure the entity&#x27;s long-term survival and harmony with the cosmos.<p>And so, our cosmic entity continues its dance through eternity, its journey ever-changing, ever-evolving, forever reaching for new heights of existence.<p>This exercise has led to a truly abstract narrative.

They inadvertently unleash sounds that should have remained silent, causing chaos in their present day.<p>&gt; The Taste of Emotions: A society where food is imbued with emotions. Chefs become the most powerful figures, as they can manipulate people&#x27;s feelings through their dishes. The protagonist, a chef, starts a revolution by serving dishes of dissent and rebellion.<p>&gt; The Color Thieves: Colors are a finite resource in the world, and can be stolen or traded. A black and white underground movement rises, challenging the color-owning elite and demanding a redistribution of hues.<p>These were all brief and vague on specifics, so I asked it to generate a longer synopsis for a sci-fi story:<p>In the wake of an unparalleled climate calamity, the remnants of humanity eke out an existence in their final sanctuary: the newly-thawed Antarctica. Society has been reimagined, birthing groundbreaking systems - the Carbon Economy and the VR Democracy. These innovations, while revolutionary, bear their own set of complexities.<p>The Carbon Economy, where emissions are currency, has slowed the march of environmental destruction, yet it has also birthed a novel divide. The affluent, equipped with advanced carbon capture technologies, enjoy an existence in verdant metropolises, while the less fortunate languish in dense urban sprawls burdened with a high carbon cost.<p>The VR Democracy, a realm where every individual has a voice, is a marvel of direct governance. Yet, it&#x27;s not without its flaws. The din of majority rule often silences the whispers of the minority, and the digital nature of this reality fosters a disconnection between virtual decisions and their tangible consequences.<p>Amidst this complex landscape, a group of digital dissidents known as the Memetic Revolutionaries rise. They wield the power of memes, not merely as vessels of humor, but as profound tools of persuasion. They craft Empathy Memes, potent capsules of shared feeling that open the eyes of the masses to the struggles of those bearing the brunt of the Carbon Economy. This emotional awakening fuels a wave of empathy within the VR Democracy, igniting a clamor for transformative change.<p>At the heart of this societal upheaval stand our protagonists: a visionary Carbon Economist determined to recalibrate the balance of the new economy, a VR Lawmaker grappling with the profound implications of a digitized democracy, and a rogue Meme Artist torn between their role in this emotional revolution and the moral quandary it presents. United by circumstance and guided by their individual principles, they must traverse the labyrinth of this new world order, safeguarding humanity&#x27;s fragile future in its last refuge.",

            "Does OpenAI block Saudi or does Saudi block ChatGPT? When I lived there, many many websites were blocked by Saudi, particularly anything to do with Islam. If OpenAI is blocking Saudi, it may be legal compliance as OpenAI is likely not yet confident in their ability to filter conversations about religion in regions where that would be <i>effectively</i> banned.<p>Saudi is currently working very, very hard to limit the spread and influence of extremism within their borders, so they&#x27;re careful about which resources for learning about islam are available.<p>Both Saudi <i>and</i> OpenAI seem to be ultra-aggressive about blocking VPN&#x27;s such as Mullvad. There are other options for getting your own servers&#x2F;VPNs that you can put OpenVPN on. When I lived in Saudi I did that, and it got around 100% of the most aggressive internet filters.",
            "OpenAI does not offer its services in Saudi Arabia. Saudis are blocked from registering. It&#x27;s not a government block which works entirely differently and shows you a page explaining that it is blocked.<p>If it&#x27;s blocked for political reasons I&#x27;d like to understand why, so we can understand their values that allow all those countries on the list but not Saudi.<p>I was able to register with a US phone number and VPN, but I&#x27;m also blocked from actually paying to get an API key.<p>I find the worry about compliance a thin excuse since a larger company like Microsoft that does have presence in the country offers Bing without issue. Same with SnapChat which has signifianct Saudi investmnet.<p>I believe it&#x27;s some kind of misguided political activism.",
            "You&#x27;ve insinuated that any block done by OpenAI would be for political reasons, but would you accept that perhaps they feel they would be breaking law in Saudi Arabia? So, &quot;legal reasons&quot;, rather than political.<p>Does Bing offer their chat AI in Saudi? Or just search results. Search results are easy to filter and have a whole framework for compliance in GCC countries that is relatively straightforward to follow.",
            "My insinuation of a political reason come after a glaring exclusion and complete silence when asked. Answering the question would help clarify their position.<p>Yes I&#x27;m talking about Bing&#x27;s chat AI. There is absolutely no indication or precedent for legal concern.<p>I know people who work at Saudi Authority for Data and AI. They have no idea why we&#x27;re blocked, while UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman can use it.<p>They&#x27;ve been holding regular AI talks and hackathons to grow the local talent. But we don&#x27;t have access to GPT4 API and it&#x27;s holding us back.",
            "[flagged]",
            "Having lived there, and lived in the homes of Saudis, I&#x27;d personally dispute that the <i>dominant</i> version of Islam there is extremist. I&#x27;m non-religious though both my parents were raised Christian and occasionally the Bible was read at my dinner table at home in the Midwest.<p>By and large, the Saudis I talked with were all very opposed to political&#x2F;religious&#x2F;militaristic violence. There was, however, a noticeably strong bias towards homophobia, especially if the context was religious discussion. I did meet a few people with extremist religious views, but they were &lt;1% from my experience.<p>Overall I&#x27;ve met a higher % of fellow Americans who, unprompted in casual conversations or professional settings, share extremist views with me like &quot;We should nuke ____ and wipe out every last person in the country&quot; or &quot;Shia Muslims are universally the most evil people on the planet&quot;, etc. Even extremist Saudis have not expressed similar sentiments to me except occasionally against Zionist Israelites (after poking, they&#x27;ll always reduce it to just the zionists, not pro-palestinian &#x2F; anti-zionist Israelis), and sometimes the royal families of the GCC countries.<p>I was located in Dhahran &#x2F; Al-Khobar &#x2F; Dammam &#x2F; Bahrain &#x2F; Abu Dhabi &#x2F; Dubai &#x2F; Oman.",
